<p><br/></p>
            <p>In another universe, Marnie sat cross-legged on an executive boardroom table. Her words echoed slightly in the shell of Great St. Mary's Church, the headquarters of the New East India Company. She was holding court to three of Lothsen's thugs, who gazed at her with rapt attention.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Honestly, just a little moisturiser every day on your face will smooth out those wrinkles that are starting to form around your eyes.&#8221; Two of the thugs were now completely focused on spotting tell-tale signs of aging on their now concerned colleague.</p>
            <p>&#8220;You,&#8221; said Marnie, pointing at the second of the thugs, &#8220;never, ever, ever wear white socks with a dark suit again.&#8221;</p>
            <p>The 6-foot-4-inch, barrel chested, muscle-bound lump of a man looked sheepishly at his ankles. &#8220;But,&#8230;"</p>
            <p>&#8220;No!&#8221; said Marnie. &#8220;There is no excuse for white socks with a dark suit, just change them for black socks tomorrow. End of subject. Now, let me look at the rest of you. The problem is that you are all so big and strong. The pinstripe business suit was simply not designed for men of your physique. Let me make a suggestion. Either get yourselves to a quality bespoke tailor who can cut the line of your suit to fit over your muscles, or &#8230; let me think&#8230; I've got it: Merino wool jumpers instead of those suit jackets! Many athletes in my universe wear this Merino because it contains lanolin and has excellent wicking properties.&#8221;</p>
            <p>The thugs stared at her, dumbfounded.</p>
            <p>&#8220;You won't smell as bad,&#8221; Marnie added by way of explanation.</p>
            <p>&#8220;What do ya mean, we smell bad?&#8221; said the ugliest of the thugs. He did not sound angry or insulted, merely curious.</p>
            <p>&#8220;I don't know about your universe, but where I come from the smell of sweat, especially not fresh sweat, is not considered a good thing,&#8221; replied Marnie choosing her words carefully.</p>
            <p>The burly men nodded.</p>
            <p>At that moment, Kane Lothsen appeared in the room. &#8220;I see your guards have been beguiled by your charm, wit, and beauty,&#8221; he said to Marnie.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Just helping them out a little. Do you think we could do a little clothes shopping, the guys and me that is? You don't need to come. I'm sure you are too busy taking over the world or something. Oops, that should have been &#8216;worlds&#8217; with an &#8216;s', one world isn't enough for you is it?&#8221;</p>
            <p>Ever since her capture Marnie had been working hard at acting tough with Lothsen, never showing weakness. Now she was inwardly just a little worried at how easily this came to her.</p>
            <p>&#8220;You want to go shopping, very amusing. I brought you here for two reasons. Do you know what they are?&#8221;</p>
            <p>Marnie cut in, &#8220;My dad will come and rescue me; you'll see.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;That is the first reason. I've tired of chasing Hector. Now he will come to me. The second reason is to go shopping, and I know just the universe, you will love it.</p>
    <p class="centered">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
            <p>If only my girlfriends from school could see what I can see now, Marnie thought. What a day they would make of it. The Cambridge market square of the universe she had just been transported to was a 15-year-old girl's dream come true. The clothes! Styles, colours, fabrics she had not imagined, all spread out before her like sweets in a candy shop. At first she tried to play it cool not wanting to give Kane Lothsen the benefit of seeing her happy and excited. But she quickly succumbed to the power of retail, with an ear to ear grin and a sparkle in her eye impossible to conceal. &#8220;Amazing, look at that dress, parts of it seem to float on their own. How does it do that? The effect is amazing. And that hat just in the next stall, it somehow blends in with the hair of the woman trying it on, how&#8230;&#8221; She checked herself. She had been kidnapped and separated from her family by a megalomaniac. She might be living a dream as far as shopping was concerned, but she had to keep her wits about her, get control of the situation. &#8220;Shoes!&#8221; All self-control was lost; she was off.</p>
            <p>Lothsen caught up with her. He had left his thugs in the other universe. Where could Marnie run to without a DNA modulator? Not having experience with teenage girls, he realised that he might have underestimated the job of monitoring one through this maze of clothing and goods. &#8220;One of my researchers discovered this universe just yesterday,&#8221; Kane said to Marnie. &#8220;From reading his report I thought you might like to do some research here yourself. You can have anything you want from here. You just have to buy it and get home with it.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Marnie's brain activity split in two, right down the middle. The left brain was deciding if the purple velvet high-heels were better than the red high-tops, and which would go nicer with those skinny jeans she had seen earlier. Her right brain deftly dealt with Lothsen. &#8220;You want me to become visible to these people, you want to see how I do that? Then you want me to just take these purple shoes (she had decided on them half way through the last sentence) back to your universe? The ability to do those things will give you the tools you need to establish your little firm as the top trader between the universes. Is that what you consider a good deal? I get one pair of shoes albeit very nice shoes, and you gain the ability to build a fortune bigger than Bill Gates ever dreamed of.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;You got me. My evil plans are too transparent. How about two pairs of shoes and a dress or jeans? Would that swing the deal?&#8221; Kane laughed at his own joke. Tell me this. If it were not shoes, but medicines in this stall, and your brother Matt was in pain and dying would that change anything? If all you had to do was purchase a bottle of pills from the table in front of you and take it back to him what would you do?&#8221;</p>
            <p>After a pause Marnie responded, &#8220;You are not to be trusted; no one person should have the amount of power you crave.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;You have been listening to that Jessica woman from Trade Free too much. Do you know how big her &#8216;organisation&#8217; is? Did she lead you to believe there are hundreds of Jessica's out there all doing good deeds wherever they go? She is a loner. There is one only member of her group. People want progress; trade is inevitable. As soon as someone has the technology to make it happen, there will be an explosion of trade across the universes. You can't stop it, nor should you want to. Take another look at those shoes. Should you be denied them any more than a pair of Converse that were made in America or China of your universe?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;I don't know about all that,&#8221; admitted Marnie, attempting to cover the seeds of doubt Lothsen had just planted in her mind. &#8220;What I do know is that my mum always told me &#8216;the end does not justify the means&#8217; and your way of getting what you want is just wrong. Keep the shoes, I don't want them anymore, not at your price!&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;So this is personal. You don't like me as a person; my mother didn't raise me to the same set of standards as yours. We are at a crossroads in the history of mankind. You and your family have one in ten billion opportunity here. I can't understand why you are not grasping it with both hands.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Lothsen paused for thought or maybe just for effect before continuing. &#8220;I'll make you a deal, a show of good faith. You are free to go. I will not hold you against your will. But before we part company, please do one little thing for me. Show me how you make yourself visible to people of universes other than your own. I have been told of your ability but have not witnessed it. Sometimes I have doubts. My scientists have not made much progress towards communication or transport between universes so I would love to see you do it. Just have a little conversation with that chap there selling flowers. I'll just watch.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Marnie's internal turmoil was going full tilt. Was Kane Lothsen such a bad guy? Could she go back to her family? &#8220;All right, I guess it won't do any harm to show you. I am only doing this because I can't see how you lying about letting me go is in your interests. You do need my family working with you. I don't see that happening, but pissing me off will make it even less likely. So, here goes.&#8221;</p>
            <p>She approached the flower stall. The wooden table was covered with all the colours nature had to offer. Somewhere in the history of this universe, design and art had taken a higher place than in Marnie's home because the flower arrangements were better than anything she had seen before. She focused on a simple collection of flowers whose combined colours, shapes and texture she found particularly beautiful. She didn't recognise the types of flowers in the bouquet but somehow they made her think of home, somewhere safe where she could appreciate beauty without any external stresses.</p>
            <p>Nothing happened. Marnie looked at the young woman behind the flower table. &#8220;Hello, I love your flowers, especially this collection. What sort are they?&#8221; But the saleswoman looked right through her.</p>
            <p>&#8220;I am trying my best.&#8221; Marnie turned to Lothsen. &#8220;I have only made myself visible a couple of times and I have no idea how it works.&#8221; She tried again and again with shoes, sausage rolls, and a fabulous waistcoat, but with no success.</p>
            <p>Lothsen was not at all upset by Marnie's failures. &#8220;I suspected this would be the result. The power of one person is small compared to the power of many. When you became visible before Rob and Matt were with you, correct?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Yes"</p>
            <p>&#8220;Let me try with you. Do you just concentrate on an object and then people can see you? Is that how it worked before?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;OK, see those light blue wool jumpers over there? Those would look great on your thugs.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;That did not work either,&#8221; said Lothsen after several tries concentrating with Marnie on various objects around the market. &#8220;Time to head back. Then I'll set you free, but where will you go and how will you get there?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="centered">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
            <p>&#8220;I've got it!&#8221; declared Sylvia. She and Hector had found a refuge of sorts in a vacant narrow boat docked up along the river Cam in Midsummer Common. They needed a place with a home-like feel. A place where they could forget about the abnormality of being invisible and in a universe that was more foreign than any of the multitudes of countries they had visited in their younger days. The boat was a bit funky. Its owners must have been this universe's equivalent of hippies as it was homely but messy. It had curtains they could close, a small bed, a cooker and all the simple comforts Hector and Sylvia desired. But it still felt empty without Marnie and Matt.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Great!&#8221; replied Hector, &#8220;What have you got and is &#8216;it&#8217; contagious?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;No stupid, it's a plan to trap Lothsen. Come over here.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Hector had been tinkering with the cooker in the little old boat, more out of curiosity than anything else. It seemed to be pretty much like a cooker back home would have been in terms of fuel, pipes, and ignition. &#8220;Coming,&#8221; he shouted starting towards Sylvia who was in the sun up on the front deck of the craft.</p>
            <p>As soon as Hector arrived at the front of the boat Sylvia hit him with questions: &#8220;What happens if you were to lose your DNA modulator thing while we are here in this universe?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;We would be well and truly stuck here unless we happened to come across another inter-universe traveller who would zap us out of here.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;That's what I thought. And how does one traveller take another with them, like you did when you brought me here? Are there rules or tricks about that?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Nothing tricky,&#8221; said Hector. &#8220;A mobile DNA modulator scans on humans touching it and anybody they are in physical contact with.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;That is kind of what I thought. Here is my plan for Lothsen. First, we hope he follows Rob and the kids to this universe. When here, we separate him from his modulator then you take him to another universe using your modulator with the stealth modification. Lothsen's gang won't be able to track you and won't know which of the millions of universes to look in. You leave him there without a modulator and return to me and our family. We live happily ever after, and Lothsen is safely out of the way where he can't bother us.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;It might work, but wouldn't it be easier to just thump Lothsen over the head with a brick? On the other hand, I don't want to be known throughout history as the first inter-universe murderer so we should probably go with your plan. How would you suggest we get the modulator off him?&#8221; Hector asked his wife.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Obviously he won't be keen to let the modulator out of his hands. You could convince him that with the aid of heat and steam you had managed to transport something to another universe. To see a demonstration he would have to go with you into a steam room or sauna. These modulators are electronic so he would have to leave his outside. I then steal it.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;It's just about wacky enough to work,&#8221; said Hector. &#8220;The whole design has a delicious similarity to pirates leaving someone marooned on a deserted island to die. Just as in the days of the real East India Trading Company. It sounds mean, but it is for the good of millions of people.&#8221;</p>
