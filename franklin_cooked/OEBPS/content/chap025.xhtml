<p class="chapterIntro">Phillip Anderson of Cavendish Laboratories was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics 1977 (shared with Mott and van Vleck), "for their fundamental theoretical investigations of the electronic structure of magnetic and disordered systems".</p>
<p><br/></p>
            <p>Rob and Matt were on their butts yet again. &#8220;Surely there is a more dignified way of travelling from one universe to another than this continually waking up from an unconscious heap on the ground every time,&#8221; Matt said.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Is this your weird chair fetish coming out again? I suppose you would like to alight gently in a leather armchair each time you have the opportunity to visit a new and exciting world? Remember, getting there is half the fun, right?&#8221;</p>
            <p>Rob and Matt were in good spirits, they had returned home from warring, tribal Cambridge. Matt had vowed to return if he could to see how it turned out for the mother with her words of wisdom to the warring tribal leaders. Rob had initiated a search for the 2 sets of digits they had recently found on the lamp post. It was not an instant success, but after some magic twiddling and programming Rob declared that universe 96274 95673 51885 75272 was where they would find Hector. That universe was where they were now.</p>
            <p>Rob looked around and said, &#8220;Well, the weather is nice. I don't see Hector waiting here at the lamp post for us, but I suppose he wouldn't be hanging around here day and night. We'll have to look around for him. You know, no matter how different each universe turns out to be the weather is always the first thing to strike me. Living in England I guess an obsession about the weather is ingrained.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Matt looked at Rob incredulously and put on a ridiculous posh English accent, &#8220;So, do you think it is going to rain tomorrow? Might I be requiring my brolly? Jolly warm today isn't it sir? Whilst we are here shall we determine whether there is anything scratched on that jolly nice lamp post just over there?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;I won't mention the weather to you ever again.&#8221; chortled Rob as he crouched down and practically crawled around the base of the post. &#8220;This one says: &#8216;What is Reality?', and doesn't have any numbers.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;The dress code in this universe is pretty strange, all the locals are wearing either crimson bath robes or what looks like yoga outfits. Apart from the odd fashion, something feels different here.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Rob stood and gazed around, after a minute he came to this conclusion, &#8220;No shopping bags.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;What?&#8221; Matt said.</p>
            <p>&#8220;In our home the Grafton shopping centre is up that street there and the town centre shops, market, and Grand Arcade Mall are on the opposite side of Parker's Piece over there. At home, 9 out of 10 people crossing this field would be carrying shopping bags. Here there are very few shoppers.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Wow, good call Sherlock, you are right again. Why do I never notice stuff like that? Guess I was still thinking about the weather! What do we do now?&#8221;</p>
            <p>Rob considered a moment, shrugged his shoulders and said, &#8220;Look around, I'm pretty sure that Hector was pointing us to this universe. If you were him, where would you be?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Dad might be in his lab, but that is where Lothsen and his goons would be waiting for him, so too obvious. He loves the Eagle pub that would be my best bet.&#8221; Rob agreed and so off they went. The robe-clad inhabitants of this world were easier to avoid walking through than people of other universes. They seemed in less of a rush as they wandered around the town. Several groups of them walked across the field then turned around and walked back to where they had come from. Matt and Rob left Parker's Piece and turned right into St. Andrews Street. In their home universe, stone 2 and 3 story buildings stood proudly on both sides of the street which would have been crammed with shoppers, university students, and office workers buzzing in and out. There were so many cyclists, buses and cars that crossing the street was always challenging. In this universe, everything moved at a slower pace, even at the busiest of intersections. There were still bikes, cars, buses and pedestrians, but they all seemed to flow around each other seamlessly as if all were somehow controlled from above. If you watch busy streets in most cities there will be people accidentally bumping into each other, doing that funny little dance that strangers do when unable to decide to go right or left to avoid each other's path. Here there was just a smooth flow. They even seemed to somehow avoid Rob and Matt even though they couldn't see them, as if guided by some invisible hand.</p>
            <p>&#8220;I want to try something.&#8221; Matt said to Uncle. Matt stood still in the middle of the pavement busy with pedestrians.</p>
            <p>Rob watched as the robe-clad locals walked around Matt rather than through him. There was no eye contact from them and no sign that they knew Matt was standing in their path, but they flowed around him like water passing around a stone in a stream. Matt and Rob repeated the experiment a few more times on the way to the Eagle Pub. It always worked. There was something different about this universe, or the people in it. These people had an awareness they had not seen before. After about 10 minutes they reached the entrance to the Eagle pub. Matt wanted to run in and see his dad but at the same time he was worried he would not be there. Rob noticed Matt's hesitation at the archway which led off the street to the pub garden. &#8220;Are you coming?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;What if Dad is not sitting at his favourite bench at the end of the garden sipping a pint of ale? Everything has gone from bad to worse with these universes. First Dad disappeared, then you were kidnapped, now Marnie, Mum, and Dad all missing. All because of me and Marnie playing with Dad's equipment. I should have told him about it.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;There's nothing you can do about that now, you and Marnie have to move on.&#8221;</p>
            <p>They walked together under the arch. Would Hector be there?</p>
    <p class="centered">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
            <p>A few minutes earlier, Sylvia and Hector watched and beamed with happiness as Matt and Rob materialised at the foot of the lamp post in Parker's Piece. The feeling was short lived as Marnie did not arrive with them. Hector and Sylvia were hidden in the shadows of large trees in the far corner of the field. They had been waiting there for hours, since returning from scratching the coded hints on the Parkers Piece lamp posts in as many universes as they dared. Their efforts had paid off as Matt and Rob had arrived, but where was Marnie?</p>
            <p>The pair watched as Matt and Rob gathered themselves up off the ground and surveyed their surroundings. They also watched as two of Lothsen's New East India Company thugs did the same 100 metres across the field. &#8220;There they are.&#8221; said Hector. &#8220;I knew Lothsen would be following them, but where is Marnie? What could have happened to her?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;We need to go to them now and find out, come on Hector.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;No!&#8221; Hector grabbed Sylvia's arm, &#8220;We can't, the goons will take us, or at least me and we still won't know about Marnie. The strategy was to lure Lothsen to this universe, trap him, then go home without being chased forever by him and his men. But, where is Marnie&#8230;. I have an idea, I'll get the East India Company goons to follow me while you get to Matt and Rob and find out about Marnie. Meet me at our boat in about half an hour.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;No, we can't split up, especially with those men chasing after you. I only just found you in these universes. There must be another way.&#8221;</p>
            <p>While they considered their options Matt and Rob began striding purposefully across the field towards the city centre. &#8220;Where do you think they are going?&#8221; Hector asked.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Looking for you, of course.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;And where they would look, I wonder. My lab?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Probably, shall we try and get ahead of them? We can ask about Marnie when they turn a corner or something while the East India goons are temporarily out of view?&#8221; suggested Sylvia.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Not a bad idea, let's try it.&#8221; replied Hector, &#8220;But we have to evade both the goons and Matt and Rob until the right moment. The quickest route to the lab is down Regent St., then Downing St. and on to Free School Lane. I don't see how we can get to the lab before them without them seeing us. Other routes I can think of are quite a bit longer. If Rob and Matt see us, then those goons will see us too.&#8221;</p>
            <p>While Hector talked about options Sylvia simply started running. Hector gave up talking to himself and took off after her. &#8220;I guess we'll just figure it out as we go then?&#8221; panted Hector as he chased after her. Rather than follow Matt and Rob through the one, obvious exit of the field towards the city centre Sylvia sprinted to Gonville Place where they turned right and headed off down the crowded pavement towards Lensfield Road planning to turn right again up Tennis Court road, cross Downing St. then head through the other labs and lecture theatres of the university to the back of the Old Cavendish lab of Hector's. It would be a run of about a mile while Matt and Rob taking a direct route would walk about half that distance. It was a good plan if they were fast enough. They could catch Matt and Rob as they turned into the lab and be completely out of sight of anyone following Matt and Rob. They could then disappear into the labyrinth of labs and university buildings, losing the goons for good.</p>
            <p>The first problem was that the pavement on Gonville Place was very crowded. &#8220;There must have been an event of some sort down here.&#8221; Hector shouted as he attempted to dodge between the locals. As with Matt and Rob the people here seemed to have some sense of the presence of Hector and Sylvia and made subconscious attempts to open a path for them, but the pavement was too crowded. Sylvia wove and dodged as best she could in the lead, but soon began to simply run through the bodies of the robed people. It was sheer terror for Sylvia, but they were going faster now. She yelled more loudly than Hector could remember since the birth of the twins, but kept going. The locals seemed to sense something had happened and often stepped aside after Sylvia passed through, leaving a clearer path for Hector to follow.</p>
            <p>By the time they entered Lensfield road, the foot traffic had lessened substantially and the going was easier. &#8220;I'll take the lead now.&#8221; offered Hector as they continued their run. Sylvia was obviously shaken but carried on at a fast pace.</p>
            <p>Eventually, they reached the ground floor of Hector's lab. Both needed a minute to catch their breath before they could speak. &#8220;Do you think we beat them here?&#8221; Hector said gasping for breath.</p>
            <p>Sylvia leaned against a wall unable to speak for a while. &#8220;I certainly hope so. I would hate for all that running to have been a waste of time. We couldn't have beaten them by more than a couple minutes. Let's wait here. If they did get here ahead of us, they will have gone up to the lab, looked around and then left. That would take a few more minutes, so we might see them going out if they are already here. Let's just pray they have not already been and gone.&#8221;</p>
            <p>So they waited. One minute passed, then another. The parents became increasingly ill at ease. They said nothing, just paced back and forth.</p>
            <p>Less than 100 yards away in The Eagle Pub Matt and Rob were similarly pacing back and forth.</p>
            <p>100 yards in another direction the New East India Company goons were also in a quandary and doing some pacing of their own. They had followed Matt and Rob across the city without being seen, and watched them go under the arch which led into the pub garden. The two big men were discussing whether they should follow them into the pub or wait just out of sight. The taller of the two with fine, greying hair in a ponytail was of the opinion that there was another exit out the back of the pub garden and they were in danger of losing their prey should Rob and Matt leave through it. The other man, with an absurdly manicured goatee beard and sideburns was certain that Matt and Rob would come out the same way they had entered. He thought that if the two of them looked around the corner into the pub or the garden there was a high risk that they would be spotted, which would ruin all their chances of being led to Hector. They both knew that if they screwed this up they would be forced to fight each other viciously as this was Lothsen's favourite form of entertainment and punishment.</p>
            <p>Another minute ticked by, then another.</p>
            <p>&#8220;How long should we wait here I wonder?&#8221; Rob asked, as much to himself as to Matt.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Another way to look at it is what else would we do? Where else should we look for Dad?&#8221; Matt replied. &#8220;Isn't it strange that this pub garden is just as full of drinkers in this universe of religious looking Buddhist types as it is back home?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Yes, odd, but more importantly Hector isn't here. Where else should we look? The lab, the library, the market square, Hector and Sylvia's favourite spot along the river? He could be anywhere. If Hector wanted us to find him in this universe, and he is not here at the Eagle, maybe we should try the lab. It's just across the street and down the alley.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;OK, but let's wait another minute or so. I'd hate to leave just before Dad arrives"</p>
