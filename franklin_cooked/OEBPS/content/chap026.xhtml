            <p>Once again Marnie felt awful as she regained consciousness after travelling to another universe. Beside her Maitland was also coming to himself. Both were on the ground in the Churchyard of Great St. Mary's. Marnie shielded her eyes from the bright glare of this universe. The sun was out and seemed brighter than normal. As her eyes slowly adjusted she realised it was not the sun that was different, but that the streets were literally paved with gold, as were many of the buildings.</p>
            <p>This was Marnie's second universe scouting trip with Maitland. Lothsen seemed to be grooming her for some job in his organisation, perhaps as another scout. Maitland could only visit so many universes. Perhaps Lothsen wanted Marnie trained up so as to increase the coverage by having another explorer.</p>
            <p>Maitland whistled to himself as he became aware of the lavish surroundings. &#8220;Could all this possibly be real gold? This is an El Dorado universe if ever I saw one. Did Lothsen point you to the El Dorado myths in those history books he made you read? &#8220;</p>
            <p>Marnie eyed the salivating Maitland, &#8220;Too much bling for my taste. Surely it can't be real gold and silver, can it? And no, Lothsen didn't specifically mention El Dorado, but the pages about it in his history book were well thumbed and marked I couldn't miss them. I had always considered a city of gold, jewels, and tremendous wealth somewhere in South America as only a myth. Now I am starting to wonder.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Maitland was having a closer look at the ornate gold railing surrounding the church's graveyard. &#8220;Of course pure gold would be too soft for metalwork like this, but it looks to me like it could be a gold alloy.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Just about every surface in this universe gleamed gold or silver and a few other equally shiny metals of a multitude of hues. Marnie asked, &#8220;I read that Sir Isaac Newton was into alchemy, turning lead into gold and all that. He, of course, attended Cambridge University. There is even an Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences on the other side of town. Maybe Newton actually figured out alchemy in this universe?&#8221;</p>
            <p>Maitland looked up from the gold railing, &#8220;Our friend Lothsen is well read when it comes to gold and riches. He told me that Newton was offered a job as a professor at the university, but instead took a job at the Royal Mint looking after England's gold reserves. Does that sound just a little bit of an odd career choice for a mathematician? I suppose it is not unlikely that somewhere in these apparently uncountable numbers of universes there is one where Newton or someone like him managed to create gold from base metals.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;So what do we do?&#8221; asked Marnie. &#8220;We can't be 100% certain this stuff is real gold. Even if it is we can't take it with us.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Lothsen will want to know about this universe at once.&#8221; replied Maitland. This is just the sort of place he sent me out to find. He'll love it here, but he'll be frustrated as hell not being able to move the gold to somewhere where it can be sold or traded. Here all he can do is admire the bright colours. Seeing this will put more pressure on the hunt for your dad, in the hope that he will be able to build a machine that will transfer goods between universes.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Once again Marnie was tempted to let Maitland in on her plan to double cross Lothsen. While considering this, she realised that actually, she didn't have a plan as such, but more of a goal. She still didn't know what to think of Maitland and decided again that she didn't trust him.</p>
            <p>Maitland was now intently studying the exterior of the church. Rather than stone as in the other universes Marnie had seen or imagined, here the presumably ancient building was clad in a metal of a reddish copper colour. Maitland was very intent on his work trying to scrape a sample off the walls.</p>
            <p>Marnie sat on the grass, it appeared just like the good, green grass of home. How she missed the familiar things from home. What would her family be doing now? Where might they all be? She was ousted from her thoughts by the sound of something dropping on the earth behind her. Turning, she saw a beautiful necklace; a gold chain supporting a tiny whale carved from what appeared to be ivory. Looking up to see where the fantastic jewellery might have been dropped from she saw nothing to indicate its source. Picking up the necklace and standing up nobody in this universe seemed able to see her. She could see that Maitland was still absorbed with the church walls. She was about to study the necklace more closely when she noticed a blue and green hat the size of a basketball walking away across the market square. The hat was atop a tall black man. Marnie was about to call out to him when Maitland appeared beside her with his mobile modulator in his hands.</p>
            <p>&#8220;We should go. Lothsen will want to know about this universe of gold.&#8221; Before she knew it Marnie was groggy and on the ground again. This time back in the horrid, dusty, dull universe of the New East India Company headquarters.</p>
    <p class="centered">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
            <p>&#8220;What are you hiding girl! Open your hand now, show us what you've got there.&#8221; Lothsen yelled at Marnie. She and Maitland were reporting back to their boss. The three of them were in Lothsen's office in the gallery of the Great St. Mary's Church. They had gone directly to him upon returning to the company H.Q. universe. To her surprise Marnie still had the ivory and gold whale necklace in her hand. That should not have been possible. Somehow she had taken it from the gold and silver universe to this one. On the short walk from the graveyard to the gallery, she had been desperately beginning to work out how best to use the necklace to her own advantage. What would James Bond do she asked herself.</p>
            <p>Timidly she showed Lothsen and Maitland the whale necklace. &#8220;My Dad gave it to me in the gold universe we just came from.&#8221; Marnie said as quietly as she could and with fake tears welling in her eyes.</p>
            <p>The two men stared at the necklace in astonishment. &#8220;How did your father get there without our knowing? And how did you bring the necklace back to this universe? You better start talking.&#8221; Lothsen took the necklace and examined it more closely.</p>
            <p>Marnie stuttered and stumbled over her words, with tears coming more frequently as she made up a story for them, a story she hoped they would believe because they wanted to. &#8220;While you were examining the construction of the church,&#8221; she looked at Maitland, &#8220;my dad appeared from out of nowhere. We hugged, but very quickly before you could see him, he hid behind a gravestone out of your view. Dad told me he had solved the problem of moving goods between universes and that he was working with Jessica Smythe. Dad and Jessica are going to publish the designs for his device, a machine that would open up trade between universes.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Lothsen was fuming, he looked towards Maitland for some sort of confirmation. Maitland shrugged in a noncommittal manner. &#8220;Carry on Marnie,&#8221; said Lothsen.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Dad wanted to take me back home with him, he was desperate, and to tell the truth I wanted to go. Then I remembered what you said to us about being able to help the millions and millions of people in many universes by organising trade between them. I could not help thinking of the TV ads at home begging us to donate money for the poor starving children of Africa or some other unfortunate place. In my home universe, we have trade like that Jessica woman wants yet children still die of hunger while others die of obesity. I want to do something big with my life, a wonderful opportunity has fallen into my lap, and I want to help you, Mr. Lothsen, to make a better world, better universes. All of this came to me in a flash when Dad was about to take me away. I told Dad how I felt. He was starting to argue, but then Maitland turned and started coming towards us. Dad pushed the necklace into my hand and vanished. I didn't really get it, your plan that is, until the moment that I saw myself working against you.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Lothsen studied the necklace, rubbing the smooth ivory, examining the delicate gold links of the chain inch by inch. He then focused on Marnie, trying to read the truth from her eyes. After a long hard stare, he returned the necklace to Marnie, &#8220;take it&#8221; he said. &#8220;Wear it and remember that moment of clarity when you put it on each day.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Now, please sit down, my two most trusted advisors. We need a plan. Hector has somehow modified this necklace to allow it to pass between universes. From that fact alone I, believe we can learn a lot. My science team have wasted a lot of time and effort trying to build equipment that would push an object from one universe to another. Hector has been smarter and has somehow modified this object in such a way that it can be carried with a person who travels. First we need to do some tests on the behaviour of this whale necklace. For example, can anyone take it to other universes, or does it have to be Marnie? Can it go to many universes or just one or two trips before the modification fails? I'll put the team on to it and to attempt to determine what is unique about the necklace. Marnie, you will work with them.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Maitland sat beside Lothsen, leaving Marnie to perch on a wooden box. &#8220;Wouldn't it be easier to capture Hector and get him to tell us what he did?&#8221; he said.</p>
            <p>Lothsen watched Marnie carefully as he answered, watching her for any tell-tale response. &#8220;Of course, we will redouble our efforts to find Hector and force his secrets from him, using means necessary.&#8221; He sneered.</p>
            <p>Marnie kept her face expressionless. &#8220;I think I know a way to get Dad on our side.&#8221; she said, wondering if she might be going too far with the double agent thing.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Go on.&#8221; said Lothsen.</p>
            <p>&#8220;I know my dad, he is very stubborn and once he starts believing he is doing the right thing then there is no changing his mind. But, he also commits himself to certain people and if he believes a person is sincere and right minded he will follow them to the ends of the earth.&#8221; Marnie paused, partly for effect and partly because she hadn't thought through her next lines yet and needed time to fill in details in her head before she said something stupid.</p>
            <p>&#8220;What is your point?&#8221; said Lothsen.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Jessica is the key to getting my dad's cooperation. Trust me on this, I'm his teenage daughter, if anyone knows how to manipulate Hector it's me. You can't just tell him to do stuff. When I wanted to take a week off school to go to Florida with a friend do you think I just asked him, or told him I was going? No way. I got my friend's dad, an astronomer, to suggest that seeing the rocket launch site at Cape Canaveral might get me more interested in physical sciences. Since Dad respected this guy who is a top astronomer, it was a done deal. It seems that Jessica holds sway over Dad in the field of these multiple universes. If I can trick her into helping us, then I am sure Dad could be swayed. Otherwise, there is no way Dad will help you.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Lothsen laughed. Once again Marnie thought she may have gone too far. Did Lothsen see through her plan? He can't, thought Marnie, I don't even know quite what my plan is so how could he?</p>
            <p>&#8220;All right Miss Marnie,&#8221; chuckled Lothsen. If you think Jessica Smythe is a softer target than Hector there is no harm in trying to use her. But it doesn't mean I am going to slow my efforts to find Hector. Maitland, can you get in touch with Miss Jessica Smythe and arrange for Marnie to see her?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Of course, I know where she lives.&#8221; said Maitland.</p>
            <p>&#8220;I am curious Marnie, Jessica Smythe is vehemently against everything that I do. How do you intend to get her on our side?&#8221; asked Lothsen.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Uh, to be honest, I don't know yet, but I'll think of something.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;I bet you will Miss Marnie, I bet you will.&#8221;</p>
