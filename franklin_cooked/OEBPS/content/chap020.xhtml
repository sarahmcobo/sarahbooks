<p class="chapterIntro">Dorothy Hodgkin of Cavendish Laboratories was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1964, "for her determinations by X-ray techniques of the structures of important biochemical substances".</p>
<p><br/></p>
            <p>Rob and Matt were back in Hector's lab, the real lab in their real home universe. They both felt a sense of security from the familiar walls adorned with dusty portraits of 20 out of the 29 Nobel winners Cavendish had produced. Hector had scavenged these paintings from the halls and walls of the old labs during the move to the new laboratory to the west of Cambridge. The collection was a hodgepodge of which no museum curator would be proud. Some were black and white photos of old men with beards looking intelligent, many were the sorts of formal painting one would find in an unloved corner of the National Gallery. One was of a young man water skiing.</p>
            <p>Hector had placed the images of his heroes around the room in chronological order starting with Lord Rayleigh who in 1904 had discovered the element Argon and explained how tiny particles smaller than the wavelength of light make the sky blue. The last portrait was of Norman Ramsey who won his Nobel for figuring out how to probe atomic matter and use it to make clocks more accurate than anything the world had ever known.</p>
            <p>Many portraits were missing and Hector had left spaces, no doubt hoping to fill them in at some point. There was also quite a bit of room on the wall after Mr. Ramsey. Hector was always optimistic about the future of Physics research in Cambridge and assumed more Nobel prizes would come. Perhaps he even hoped for an image of himself on the wall.</p>
            <p>&#8220;That was a waste of time.&#8221; Said Matt spinning slowly round and round in his father's desk chair.</p>
            <p>Matt had tired of watching Rob at the desk flipping half-heartedly through the documents they had worked so hard on, the papers mapping out all they knew about the multiverse, the people they had met, and Hector's calamitous experiment. Rob said nothing, but continued turning from page to page of their notes and diagrams. &#8220;We must have missed something,&#8221; Rob muttered. &#8220;But what?&#8221;</p>
            <p>Matt continued his pacing back and forth in the small lab, examining its contents as if some artefact from his father's office was hiding a vital clue. Moving an envelope off a chair, he read again the odd message on it they had discarded before: &#8220;Round Pies, 20p each.&#8221;</p>
            <p>In Rob's hand was the page titled &#8216;Odd Stuff&#8217; on which they had put things they remembered which did not seem to fit any rational category.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Hold on a minute,&#8221; Matt said to Rob. Look at this, Round Pies 20p here on this envelope in my hand, in your hand are more references to a blue circle with a 20 in it from the Mayan universe and 20 pieces of pie in the no money universe, and that odd poster we just saw in the colour-blind universe advertising a Magnum P.I. for Â£20. Everything has a 20 in it. I don't see many other numbers in all of our notes. Could that be more than a coincidence?&#8221;</p>
            <p>Rob pondered and shuffled some papers, scratched his chin, looked at Matt and studied the papers again. At last he spoke, &#8220;Not only is the number 20 over represented, but also check this out, each one of them also as a reference to Pi.</p>
            <p>&#8220;What? Pi as in the 3.14 number, something about the circumference of a circle that Pi?&#8221;</p>
            <p>Rob jumped up, &#8220;Yes, that Pi. Why would a normal pie that you can eat be described as round, they are always round? It must be a clue, a hint for something, and Magnum P.I. has not been on TV for about 100 years, why would there be a stage show about him? And the number 20 in a circle, even you associate pi with circles. These have got to be clues, but to whom and about what?&#8221;</p>
            <p>Rob sat down again and poured over their documents and notes with renewed vigour. &#8220;Are the answers in those notes?&#8221; Matt asked.</p>
            <p>&#8220;They have to be. Hector, Sylvia and Marnie are all depending on us to find them. Do you see anything else about 20, Pi, circles, or anything like that?&#8221; Rob was truly in his element now, digging through data like an archaeologist taking his first steps into King Tut's tomb.</p>
    <p class="centered">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
            <p>&#8220;What have I done?&#8221; Marnie sat bolt upright in a cold sweat abruptly awakened from a deep sleep. She sat staring blankly into the dark of her tiny room in the New East India Company headquarters. It was pitch black in her windowless cell, but she knew immediately where she was from the dusty smell of centuries old stone and mortar. &#8220;Who am I talking to? There is nobody to hear me. I must be going mad.&#8221; She got up off her musty cot and poked her head out the door into the main room of Great St. Mary's church. It was empty with faint moonlight filtering in through what was left of some stained glass windows. It was not a person or noise that had woken her. She had been having an extraordinarily vivid dream, swimming with sea turtles in a tropical sea. In the dream, she had been befriended by three of the giant, graceful turtles and they swam together with Marnie like dolphins under the waves. Marnie felt she had been invited to a glimpse of heaven while still living, in fact, she felt more alive and peaceful in that dream than she could ever remember feeling in real life.</p>
            <p>The blissful, weightless swimming was interrupted by her brother Matt driving past in an old pickup truck. He was being chased by a large bumble bee. Matt was clearly panicked, driving faster and faster attempting to evade the over-sized bee. Marnie marvelled at the weirdness of the dream. Matt could not drive, he did not have a pickup, cars don't work underwater and neither do foot long bumble bees. When seeing Matt in the dream, her first thought was annoyance as there he was, interrupting her perfect experience. She swam behind a rock before Matt saw her and the turtles. As she peeked out at the developing chase scene, she watched in horror as Matt attempted a sharp turn evading a coral. He didn't make the turn and crashed horribly, the pickup bursting into flames. Marnie glimpsed Matt's burning face looking at her pleading, &#8220;Why didn't you try to help me?&#8221; By the time he finished the question only his eyes were left. Those eyes stared at Marnie huddling behind the rock with the three turtles.</p>
            <p>Still in the dream, the burning pickup was replaced by her father's DNA machine in his lab. Matt's eyes morphed into Hector's eyes. &#8220;Why did you change the settings?&#8221; asked her father's eyes. At that moment, Marnie woke.</p>
            <p>&#8220;I have created this universe that now has me in this prison&#8221; she shouted to the empty room. The words echoed around the hall. The hall that for hundreds of years had heard the oratory of scholars and theologians did not comment. Marnie waited for a reply even though she knew the place to be empty. She craved someone, anyone to hear her. She shouted again, &#8220;I changed the settings on my father's experiment and created this world.&#8221; Still no reply. She continued shouting. For some reason Marnie felt she had to shout, just thinking or mumbling these words would not give her redemption. &#8220;Just like a coin flip will land on both heads and tails and each will create a universe I could have not touched dad's equipment, and in some other universe I didn't, but this universe exists because I did.&#8221; Marnie waited in the dark empty church again.</p>
            <p>Silence.</p>
            <p>Marnie sat quietly in a pew that had been left in the corner of the church. For the first time in her life, she prayed.</p>
            <p>More silence. Morning came and the sun's rays shone through the stained glass windows. Marnie woke up again, this time in the church pew and this time with a sense of purpose.</p>
