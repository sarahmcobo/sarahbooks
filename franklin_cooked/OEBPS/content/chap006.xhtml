<p class="chapterIntro">Francis Aston of Cavendish Laboratories received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1922, "for his discovery, by means of his mass spectrograph, of isotopes, in a large number of non-radioactive elements, and for his enunciation of the whole-number rule."</p>
<p><br/></p>
            <p>Hector looked up from the floor. The walls around him were wrapped in bookshelves. As his eyes came into focus they alighted upon such titles like &#8216;The Just William Annual - 1978,&#8217; and &#8216;Asterix in Belgium.&#8217; Remembering being chased by the Asian thugs from the strange temple into a side street of Cambridge Hector struggled to stand. Had he been drinking? It felt like one heck of a hangover. He guessed this was going to happen every time he jumped universes.</p>
            <p>There was no sign of his pursuers. Hector crept down the creaky, old, wooden stairs of the bookshop. Was he in a different universe he thought? This little building nestling between two larger ones was a bookshop in his home universe and in the temple universe. If this was a third universe, what were the chances of it being a bookshop again? &#8220;I hope I have not led those thugs back to my home universe after all. I wouldn't want them to find Sylvia and the kids and using them as leverage in any way.&#8221; Hector mumbled to himself on the bottom step. There was barely room for 4 or 5 customers to squeeze around each other in the tiny shop. The whole place smelled of musty manuscripts. This was not a temporary home for this month's International Bestsellers, the words stored between bindings on these shelves were here for the long haul. Sometime in the next 5 or 10 years a customer would browse among the titles and realise that he or she was in just the right mood to purchase and read &#8216;William and the Witch - 1964'. The words in that particular book would have to wait patiently until that day.</p>
            <p>Hector edged his way towards the door squeezing between customers who were oblivious to him even when in close proximity. &#8220;If people can't see me, I must not be home", Hector thought.</p>
            <p>Peeking out the door, there was no sign of anyone watching him so Hector tentatively stepped onto the pavement and turned towards the grounds of Kings College. Would he find a temple, a college, or a surprise when he turned the next corner?</p>
            <p>Seeing the college more or less how it looked at home, Hector was unsure what to think. The people here obviously couldn't see him so his DNA and theirs must be on different frequencies meaning that he was not in his home universe, but everything looked pretty normal. &#8220;Perhaps the differences are simply very subtle,&#8221; he thought. He needed more time to think. What Hector normally did at a time like this was either to go for a run or sit in the corner of a pub with a pale ale and wait for things to begin to make sense. As he had just been chased around Cambridge, the ale option was now far more appealing.</p>
            <p>The Eagle pub was nearby and Hector made his way there on auto-pilot. While he walked slowly his mind raced. Why were those men trying to capture him? How is it they could see him? His arm was still sore from being manhandled so roughly. Their DNA must have been on the same vibrational pattern as his, meaning that they too were travellers, not natives of the universe with the Mayan temple in the centre of Cambridge. All this meant that his invention was not original but already existed. Of course, if there are innumerable universes then by sheer numbers, trans-universe travelling would have been invented in many other universes before his. Perhaps it was just a coincidence that Hector showed up in a universe where that pair of rather unpleasant travellers happened to be? Hector spied his favourite pub and quickened his pace. He didn't like coincidences. They always turned out to be something else.</p>
            <p>Ahead of him a dozen foreign school children on a school trip had formed a pack milling around one of Cambridge's more unique attractions. The kids were young teenagers, probably from Italy, although he was too far away to hear their language. Like teenagers everywhere, they faced the simultaneous ambitions of attempting to exude individuality while also desperately needing to fit in with their peers. These Italian kids wore a uniform of designer clothes and big, bright, plastic headphones. They had gathered around the famous mechanical Corpus Clock, a timepiece consisting of an evil looking grasshopper eating time as it steps around a four foot gold disk.</p>
            <p>Hector noted with great interest that something as odd as a mechanical grasshopper clock would exist in more than one universe. He remembered how much little Marnie loved the creature when she was little. As a toddler, Marnie would beg Hector to take her to watch the &#8216;hop&#8217; as she called it. She could easily charm her father away from whatever he was doing to go watch it. Little Marnie would stare in awe as the mechanical legs stepped over the rotating gold clockwork discs. The mechanism seemed to set Marnie's mind at ease and off on adventures of its own. She would stare intently for several minutes then ask Hector some off the wall question such as how do fish breathe underwater or why bricks were red. He remembered explaining to her that the clock was built as a tribute to a clockmaker who had solved the problem of ships finding their longitude as they sailed around the globe back in the 18th century. Hector half chuckled at the irony of not having any idea where he was now two and a half centuries later.</p>
            <p>The pack of Italian kids moved on revealing a fat man in a suit and the two thugs that Hector had so recently escaped from. In an instant, Hector ducked back behind an overweight American family walking in the other direction while pulling chips and burgers from several McDonald's bags which seemed to cling to them like flies to flypaper. I'm looking at another constant across the universes thought Hector, enjoying the smell of the chips. He managed to evade the Mongolians by reaching another side street and running across the city until he was sure he had lost them.</p>
            <p>Catching his breath sitting at a dark, back table of a pizza restaurant, Hector pulled out the notebook and pen he always had with him and began to draw, write, and analyse his predicament. After a while, he came to the conclusion that he would have to stay in this universe as long as possible. The fat man and the Mongolians must be able to track him when he jumped from one universe to another. That was logical enough, it took an enormous amount of energy and created a ripple in many levels of molecular structure to make a universe jump.</p>
            <p>Hector's mind settled on an idea. He would devise a way to hide his tracks. He couldn't risk the Mongolians tracking and chasing him back home. What would Sylvia, the kids and Rob be doing? Rob was in the lab when Hector jumped to the Mayan temple universe. Figuring out how to travel across universes without leaving a trace the Mongols could follow would take time. With Hector gone missing would Rob try to follow him? If he did, then he too would be in danger.</p>
            <p>Hector needed somewhere to work. He had to figure out a way to move around between universes without the mysterious fat man and his Mongolians following him. Only then could he get back home to his family without endangering them. Where to work? He was in a Cambridge, but not his own Cambridge. He could not go to his lab in this universe could he? Surely if anyone was looking for him that is where they would be watching, no he had to stay away from places he would normally visit in his home Cambridge. But he needed a laboratory.</p>
            <p>Still hiding in the dark corner of the pizza restaurant Hector considered his options. If he were at home there were several friends and colleagues he could call upon. Here they wouldn't be able to see him. What if he ran into another copy of himself here? Presumably the local Hector would be completely unaware of him. That would be just too weird to contemplate. No, he would be on his own.</p>
            <p>Where could he find a physics lab in Cambridge he would not be expected to be found in. Of course, the New Cavendish Labs to the west of the city. Hector had always shunned them. If they existed in this universe, there should be no risk of running into himself or anybody looking for him.</p>
    <p class="centered">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
            <p>The three had switched on the modulator again and woke up in their usual heap on the floor of the lab just as before. They searched the building for traces of Hector but found no sign of him. &#8220;I was really, really hoping Dad would be sitting at his desk in the lab waiting for us to find him,&#8221; said Marnie sadly. &#8220;Even a note or sign that he had been in this universe would have helped. I feel terrible about all this.&#8221;</p>
            <p>On the streets of the city it seemed like the same sunny spring day Matt, Marnie and Rob thought they had left behind. Their only assurance that they had actually travelled to another universe was the absence of their mother and the fact nobody could see them here.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Remember last Christmas?&#8221; Marnie asked as they ventured out into a city that was sort of like their home Cambridge. There was no South American temple this time. People on the street were speaking English to each other. After some trials, it was soon established that the three of them were invisible to the natives of this universe.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Yes, what about Christmas? Matt asked. Last year mum and dad thought it would be interesting to have a family Christmas on the Trans-Siberian railway.</p>
            <p>&#8220;We rode the train from Moscow to Beijing. Santa dropped in somewhere near Ekaterinburg, Russia and gave us new MP3 players loaded with music. Then we invented a competition to find the least appropriate soundtrack to Mongolia. I chose the Black Eyed Peas, and you went with Lady Gaga.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Of course I remember,&#8221; Matt said. &#8220;Mum and Dad won the competition with a block vote for The Beach Boys.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Marnie carried on, &#8220;Yes, listening to Surfing Safari through headphones while watching Mongolian horsemen herding camels was too surreal. My eyes and ears were sending such different signals that my poor brain couldn't sensibly stitch them together. I bring it up because it seems like that again, here in this version of Cambridge. To my eyes things look pretty normal, but another part of me is saying that something is not quite right.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;I know exactly what you mean. Something here is out of phase or something. That reminds me though: on the train in Mongolia, the blues guitar of Stevie Ray Vaughan suited the Mongolian steppe as an umbrella fits a rainy day in London. Strange.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Rounding the corner by the Eagle pub they spotted their favourite Italian ice cream man there, right in front of them. &#8220;I would love an ice cream right now", said Rob salivating just slightly, &#8220;but Antonio won't be able to see us in this universe will he?&#8221; Even so, they naturally gravitated towards the little van with &#8220;Antonio's Italian Ice Cream&#8221; emblazoned on the side. Matt was concentrating on the pineapple flavour. Marnie was thinking coconuts, Rob was a chocolate mint ice cream fan.</p>
            <p>&#8220;What would you like? A cone or a dish? Large or small?&#8221; said Antonio.</p>
            <p>&#8220;You can see us!&#8221; cried Marnie.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Of course, do you think I have gone blind? Although you three did sort of sneak up on me. Are you learning some spy tricks or something? Did you just remove your invisibility cloak?&#8221;</p>
            <p>Not wasting time on explanations, Marnie put in their order for three double cones of much needed comfort food.</p>
            <p>After the ice creams were served up Marnie handed Antonio a ten pound note from her pocket and got started eating while she waited for the change.</p>
            <p>&#8220;This money is no good here, did you just come in from outside the WoHoCeZo or something?&#8221; said Antonio.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Come in from outside the what?&#8221; Marnie and Matt in unison. Rob had a mouthful of ice cream and so just looked quizzically at Antonio.</p>
            <p>&#8220;The WoHoCeZo: &#8216;Work Hour Certificate Zone.&#8217; Where are you from? You can't have been here long.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Rob swallowed and said &#8220;We just arrived. We're looking for a long lost relative. How can we pay for the ice creams?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;If you just arrived in this zone you won't have any work hour certificates, will you? No matter, I have some chores you can do to earn them. I was just about to pack up and go home. Help me clean up the van when you've finished eating.&#8221;</p>
            <p>While putting lids on the ice cream tubs and wiping up spills, Matt asked, &#8220;Where we come from we don't have work certificates. What are they? Don't you use money here?&#8221;</p>
            <p>Antonio looked surprised but answered while washing the ice cream scoops. &#8220;A work certificate is exactly what it sounds like. You work an hour for me and I'll give you a certificate. The certificate can be traded for whatever someone wants to give you for it, ice cream for example.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;That sounds like good old money to me,&#8221; said Marnie, picking up rubbish from the ground around the van.</p>
            <p>&#8220;It has some very important differences,&#8221; said Antonio. This Cambridge WoHoCeZo was the first one in the world. It was started in the Great Depression of the 1930s by staff and students of the university. The idea was invented right here, too, by a physical education student of all people. His name was Peter Popper or something daft like that. His idea was simple: one cannot lend or borrow certificates, so there is no debt. They can be saved, but can't be invested and there is no interest to be earned from them. You simply work to get things you want to buy.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Rob looked up from wiping the little table in the van. &#8220;That sounds fine for buying ice cream, but how could you save up enough to buy a house or something really expensive?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Because nobody in the zone can borrow money, prices of things just don't get so high that people can't afford them. Also, we live simple lives and don't have as much stuff as people outside the zones who continue living with regular money and big debts.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;How could the switch have been made to this system?&#8221; Matt asked, now putting napkins and plastic cups into boxes on the floor of the van. &#8220;Surely those with a lot of money would not give it up? Or did they get a lot of certificates for their cash?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Remember, this all started in the depression. Most of those with lots of money had already lost it and many who did not want to participate simply moved out of Cambridge to a city that was not taking part in the trial. It was meant to be temporary and confined to this city. But, people liked it and it spread first around the U.K. and now all over the world. I read somewhere that almost one-fourth of the world's population use work certificates instead of money now. Hey, where did you all go? Come back, you have not earned your work certificates yet!&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;We are still right here!&#8221; said Marnie, but Antonio couldn't see or hear them any longer. Antonio then walked right through Matt as he turned in the small space of the ice cream van towards the door.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Ugh, I hate it when people walk right through me.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Uncle Rob started shouting at Antonio and everyone else within earshot, but they were inaudible and invisible again. &#8220;How could that have happened? It's as if we were fully here in the universe without money and now we are just observers of it again.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;I must admit I was getting a little bored with the explanations about the certificates,&#8221; said Marnie. &#8220;It may be fascinating to a student of economics, but I am worrying about Dad. Do you think he is in this universe somewhere?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;I don't know", said Matt, &#8220;but we were just given a huge hint about what made this universe different from ours. If we find out more about that Peter Pucker or whatever his name was we might be able to get the signature of this place so we can map it, then we can return here if we need to.&#8221; Now, I just want to map it and get back to Mum.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Good point,&#8221; said Rob. &#8220;I was just thinking: if your father is here, he would also have to research Peter Popper to map the universe, just as we need to.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;The City Library is just down the road, let's go there.&#8221; said Marnie striding off. Rob and Matt followed.</p>
            <p>Cambridge is one of only a small handful of cities that have a central library in their main shopping mall. Who knows why, but that's where it is. &#8220;They may not have cash here, but the human desire to shop is still strong. I guess they buy all this stuff with work credits,&#8221; said Marnie, narrowly missing a hippie-looking student heading towards a clothing shop. The thing about shoppers is that they see something they desire in a shop window and change direction instantly to get closer to it. To get through the crowded mall without people walking through them the three visitors had to dance around - always observant and quick on their feet to avoid sharing the same physical space with another person.</p>
            <p>Just outside the library, Rob stood and looked longingly at a messy, hand drawn poster advertising twenty pieces of blueberry pie for only £10. &#8220;I guess less effort is put into slick advertising in this economy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At least they still have my favourite flavour of pie!&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Let's just find out about Peter Pooper or whatever his name is so we can locate Dad,&#8221; said Marnie, heading into the library.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Wait just a minute", said Matt. &#8220;Why would the blueberry pie be priced in pounds rather than work credits? I don't understand this place.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="centered">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
            <p>Rob and Marnie were pouring over history books in the back corner of the library when a short, ugly, black-suited, bald man appeared at Matt's side. There was a smell of dried horse dung in the dusty air that hung around him.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Hello young Matt Moncrieff, are you finding what you need here?&#8221; he asked.</p>
            <p>If Matt had been unable to see or smell him, his pleasant, cultured accent might have been comforting. Matt stepped back involuntarily. &#8220;Who are you? How can you see me?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;I am the one you are going to thank for returning your father to you,&#8221; he said. Matt stepped back further, this time, not out of fear or surprise, but to avoid the smell of his breath. &#8220;My name is Santos, from the New East India Company. We have been watching you and your family for some time.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Do you have my father? Where is he?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;He has joined us for now. We will return him to you when we are done with him.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;I want to see him now. Where is he?&#8221;</p>
            <p>There were sounds of a scuffle from the history section of the library. Rob and Marnie were surrounded by three more men who were just as ugly as the one calling himself Santos. One of them had Rob by the scruff of the neck. Marnie was kicking and clawing, but to no effect.</p>
            <p>Santos winked at them, then they were gone—simply vanished, taking Rob with them. No one else in the library had any idea that right there among the history books, a kidnapping had taken place.</p>
            <p>Marnie and Matt huddled together on the floor in the smallest corner of the library traumatized by the kidnapping of their Uncle Rob. &#8220;What have we done?&#8221; Marnie sobbed quietly. &#8220;Dad is gone, and now Uncle Rob too. Who were those men?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Remember when we were seven years old? Mum and Dad took us on holiday in Greece&#8221; Matt said. &#8220;We left the dock on a gorgeous sunny day in that creaky old fishing boat. You had just spilled coconut ice cream down your new blue and green top. Dad tripped on a loose plank on the dock and dropped his phone into the sea. None of that mattered, even to Mum, since the sky was so blue, the sea glowing turquoise, the air perfectly fresh, and the sun warmed us all in such a way that nothing could ever go wrong. We played for hours building sandcastles on the beach while Mum and Dad read books under that olive tree near the beach.&#8221;</p>
            <p>The slightest precursor of a smile started to form in the stiff shell that Marnie's face had become since Rob and been taken. The twins could often console each other in hard times with stories. Sometimes they were real, often fictitious; it didn't matter, stories could take them to a happier place.</p>
            <p>Marnie's face opened a little. &#8220;This isn't fun anymore. I just want Dad and Uncle Rob back, and all of us all back home with Mum. I want to go back to our own home where everything is normal again.&#8221; Tears were starting now.</p>
            <p>Matt continued the story, not knowing what else he could do. &#8220;Remember those five tiny turtles, each about as big as a 50p coin, that made a home in your sand castle on the beach, they swam in the little pond you made inside the castle walls, and sunned themselves on the rocks I put in for them. Mum even let us drink three Cokes each that day.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Marnie was now lost in the memory, &#8220;Those little turtles had such a nice day, and we fed them bits of our lunch. They seemed to love the cheese, but not the bread.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="centered">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
            <p>It was now almost exactly 24 hours from when Rob had been taken by the men from the New East India Company. Marnie was again in the history section of the Cambridge library in the universe of no money. There was a pair of very comfortable old leather armchairs just next to the poetry books. These were just the type of chairs you search out when you want to plop down for a short power-rest: just upright enough to keep you awake, but relaxed enough to really sink into. Matt was sitting in one of these seats fretting about his father and Uncle. They had decided it was best to hang around in that universe, in the library as long as possible and hope for the return of their uncle.</p>
            <p>One instant the chair next to Matt was vacant, the next instant it was occupied by his very groggy Uncle Rob.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Man, it is good to see you again!&#8221; Rob said, when he recovered from the inter-universe jump he had just completed.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Uncle Rob!!!&#8221; shouted Marnie. They had learned to break the taboo of not talking loudly in the library, as no one in this universe since Antonio the ice cream man was able to see or hear them. She dashed over, pulled him from the seat, and gave him a great hug. &#8220;How did you get back to us, where were you? Where is Dad? Did you see him? Did those smelly men do anything to you? Why did they let you go? Or did you escape?&#8221;</p>
            <p>Marnie finally paused for breath allowing Rob cut in. &#8220;We have a lot to talk about, and we need to go somewhere more private.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;But nobody can hear us,&#8221; Matt said.</p>
            <p>&#8220;We can't be so sure about that. Where can we go where we can be alone, or at least see anyone approaching?&#8221;</p>
            <p>After a moment's thought, Marnie answered, &#8220;Parker's Piece is not far away. We could sit in the middle of that big open field and easily be out of earshot of anybody,&#8221; answered Marnie, slightly confused.</p>
            <p>Off they went. Matt kept a keen eye on his Uncle as they exited the library. Rob was twitchy, his eyes constantly darting this way and that. In their pre-abduction state of innocence, they had begun to ignore these other universe people, since they couldn't interact with them anyway, but now Rob was looking intently at everybody, apparently trying to find something in their faces or posture.</p>
            <p>&#8220;What are you looking for?&#8221; Matt whispered.</p>
            <p>&#8220;He should be looking for me,&#8221; they heard from a male voice from behind them.</p>
            <p>There stood the man they had glimpsed so briefly in the instant of travelling back home from the Fitzwilliam Museum in the Mayan universe. &#8220;The name is Maitland,&#8221; he said holding out a hand. This was the second time he had introduced himself. Neither Matt nor Rob accepted the offered handshake.</p>
            <p>Maitland was not smelly like the men who had taken Uncle Rob. Also, unlike the New East India Company gang of thugs, he was well dressed in a tacky sort of way. He wore a shiny blue business suit, crisp white shirt, and a perfectly knotted shiny pink tie. He was clean-shaven, with short hair and had no visible scars or other signs of a violent life. He had a slightly timid air. Matt thought that, under normal circumstances, Maitland would be intimidated by them rather than the other way around.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Rob is correct,&#8221; said Maitland. &#8220;We should find a place where we will not be overheard.</p>
            <p>&#8220;How can we possibly do that when people like you can just pop in from out of nowhere? Is this like Dr. Who where time travellers drop in unannounced?&#8221; asked Marnie.</p>
            <p>&#8220;You will learn that time travel is pure science fiction and simply does not happen. However, cross universe travel is real.&#8221; Said Maitland.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Why on earth should we trust you? What sort of a name is Maitland anyway?&#8221; asked a suspicious Marnie.</p>
            <p>Matt poked her in the ribs, quite hard. &#8220;Marnie, shut up and at least give the guy a chance. He hasn't harmed us, yet anyway.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Follow us if you want, we can't stop you.&#8221; Said Rob to Maitland. They then strode off past several mobile phone shops, toy shops, and a shop selling giant rolled up pizzas. Matt had so many questions, but weaving through the crowds did not allow for discussion. Although they could simply walk through people they all found that experience abhorrent. It felt like an invasion of privacy in the deepest sense; both of their privacy and that of the person they permeated through.</p>
            <p>At last they exited the shopping mall, crossed a couple of streets, and navigated towards an open patch of grass near a lamp post in the large field known as Parker's Piece. The land was traded to the city by Trinity College in 1613. Edward Parker, a cook at the university obtained rights to farm the land and it has kept his name ever since.</p>
            <p>Marnie and Matt automatically headed for the lone lamp post at the very centre of the field. The spot was a favourite of their dad's. In their universe, this lamp post was something of a local monument because it had the words &#8216;Reality Checkpoint&#8217; scratched on the base. Their Dad said it was originally inscribed many years ago by college students in need of a touchstone after experimenting with mind altering drugs. Over many years, generations of students made sure the saying stayed in situ. Whenever the council repainted the lamp post, it was only a matter of days before &#8216;Reality Checkpoint&#8217; was scratched on it again. Hector loved this because he said it was a link to the past that was the student's own. It also made him just a little more secure to see that reality was still intact every time he walked across the field.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Is the lamp post message as it should be?&#8221; asked Matt.</p>
            <p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Marnie, &#8220;In this universe the base of the post says: &#8216;Reality - simply not enough!'"</p>
            <p>The four sat on the grass. &#8220;You three have something that a lot of people want.&#8221; he said. &#8220;Many of us have been watching you since you started travelling to other universes.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Who are you people?&#8221; Matt asked.</p>
            <p>Maitland ignored him and continued. &#8220;Your father is a brilliant man. Did he explain how your life, as you thought of it a couple of days ago, is just one of an almost infinite number of parallel universes? Did you ever wonder what would have happened if your parents had never met and you were not born? Well, there is a universe out there like that. Even turning left out of the grocery store one morning instead of right could spawn a different future if something significant resulted from that choice.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Sorry, you've lost me,&#8221; said Marnie.</p>
            <p>Maitland took a coin from his pocket. &#8220;Call it, heads or tails.&#8221; he said flipping the coin into the air.</p>
            <p>Marnie called &#8220;tails&#8221; as the coin landed on the grass. &#8220;Hey, I got it right.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;You got it right in the universe we are now in — call this the &#8216;tails&#8217; universe. We just spawned another universe where that coin landed as heads. Chances are the head or tail will make no significant difference and those two universes will merge back together soon, being effective duplicates. However, if there is a significant difference, the two universes, or futures, will forever remain separate. They will run side by side, parallel through time.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; Matt said, &#8220;I'm sure I read this in a fiction book at school. You are just making all this up. What was that book? Ah, Philip Pullman, &#8216;The Subtle Knife&#8217; I think. Anyone remember that?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Just because a book is sold as fiction it doesn't mean it can't be true.&#8221; said Maitland.</p>
            <p>Rob spoke now. &#8220;Hector was working on the theory that everything that can happen, does happen somewhere. Every time you flip a coin it lands as both heads and tails. Each future has a slightly different wave pattern, harmonics, or a signature—if you want to think of it that way. Just as each human has unique fingerprints and DNA.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Marnie felt she was starting to understand, &#8220;So, when we use the stick and Frisbee thing to travel between universes, we are visiting parallel universes separated by a choice or happening in the past that created multiple universes from one? Is that how it works?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;That is about right,&#8221; answered Rob. &#8220;Your Dad's brilliance was in working out that all these potentially infinite numbers of universes coexist side by side because oscillations of every molecule and DNA particle in one universe are on a different frequency than that of every other universe. Hector went further and figured out that, in theory, a machine could alter one's DNA oscillation frequencies and make you exist in another universe.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Maitland carried on, &#8220;As I said, your father is brilliant, but consider the millions of parallel universes: in one, your father invented these tools you used to travel to different universes. Do you think that invention was unique in all those universes? Of course not. I come from a universe different to the one you call home. Those men from the New East India Company come from still other universes. We also have the tools to travel between universes.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;What do the New East India Company people want with Dad and us?&#8221; Matt asked.</p>
            <p>&#8220;The known technology can only go so far,&#8221; answered Maitland. &#8220;You see, human DNA turns out to be extremely powerful. More powerful than machines are ever likely to be. The really interesting thing though is that several humans with close connections are capable of combining their DNA vibrations in a way that is absolutely stunning in terms of power. You three, as close family, may even be able to interact with people in different universes. That is power the New East India Company doesn't have and is desperate to get.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;We have had little contact with one person here in this universe,&#8221; said Matt. &#8220;Antonio the ice cream man spoke with us as if we were completely normal, but it only lasted for a few minutes.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Interesting, what were you thinking about when you first made contact with him?&#8221; asked Maitland.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Ice cream!&#8221; the three answered in unison.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Could that be it?&#8221; interjected Rob. &#8220;We were all concentrating hard on the same thing and that is all it takes for people here to see us?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;That could be how it works,&#8221; said Maitland &#8220;Who knows, perhaps when you all focus on the same thing your DNA hums together like playing a chord on a guitar.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;But what good would these powers be to the New East India Company?&#8221; Matt asked.</p>
            <p>Rob piped in &#8220;Now it is starting to make sense to me. The New East India Company wants to make money and gain power in the multiverses. With their existing tools, they are limited to taking random jumps into different universes and are not able to directly interact with people there. That is pretty limiting for an aspiring trading company.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;What did they want from you, Uncle Rob? Why did they return you after the kidnapping?&#8221; Marnie asked.</p>
            <p>&#8220;They took me to a pretty dull universe. The Cambridge in that universe is mostly deserted. It looked like there had been a war and we lost; many of the buildings were destroyed. The New East India Company have set up headquarters in the Great St. Mary's Church, the one just beside the market square. There must have been twenty of their goons there, not all as ugly as the ones who captured me though. The inside of the church was covered with maps and planning charts. They sat me down and quizzed me at length about our tools and technology and Hector's theories. They told me that if I didn't cooperate we would never see Hector again. In the end, I told them all I know. I'm guessing they let me come back to you two for the reasons Maitland just explained. The technology and theory will only get them so far. Our potential lies in the three of us together. That's what they want to tap into.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;And that is exactly why you three need to be careful.&#8221; said Maitland. &#8220;The New East India Company will be watching you whenever they can and looking for ways to take advantage of anything you learn.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;But what about Dad? Did you see him? Do they have him?&#8221; asked Matt.</p>
            <p>&#8220;No&#8221; answered Rob sadly. &#8220;I didn't see him. They obviously knew of him, but when I demanded to see him they just laughed. I got the impression they don't actually know where he is.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Matt stood and paced around the little group sitting on the grass, &#8220;So we are in this field in Cambridge in a universe where the people here don't use cash. And somehow, right beside us is our home universe, and beside that is a universe where the sky is green or some other weird thing. Is that right?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;You've got it.&#8221; replied Rob. &#8220;Here is what I think:</p>
            <p>First, Hector is probably hopping from universe to universe. He might think we are looking for him and he may or may not know about the New East India Company.</p>
            <p>Second, the New East India Company is trying to control trade between universes but as yet can't physically exist in any of them so they are pretty limited.</p>
            <p>Third, we, as close relatives, can concentrate together and be physically seen in a parallel universe.</p>
            <p>Fourth, we don't know where we might end up in our next jump, but we can map it and return to universes where we have been if we map them by figuring out their signature or difference between it and our home universe.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Marnie stood up, followed quickly by Maitland, who suddenly looked slightly troubled at being the only one sitting while the others paced around him. He also looked very relieved as he no longer needed to worry about grass stains on his silky business suit.</p>
            <p>&#8220;I think we must give Dad the benefit of the doubt,&#8221; said Marnie. &#8220;He always figures things out before anybody else does. Either we are wrong, or there is a good reason why dad can't wait for us or leave messages.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Maitland straightened his suit and spoke. &#8220;I suspect a game of cat and mouse is being played out. My guess is that Hector is doing his best to elude the New East India Company. They are chasing him and trying to watch you. If you three and Hector all got together in the same universe and focused your DNA vibrations sufficiently, your combined power may be too much for the East India Company to control. On the other hand, if they are prepared they could snare you all at once and somehow use you to achieve their plans. You must be very careful.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Why? What is so dangerous?&#8221; asked Matt.</p>
            <p>&#8220;The Leader of the New East India Company comes from a universe which has a different set of morals that you or I are used to. One person he had working as a scout displeased him. The scout was never seen again, but there are rumours that Lothesen keeps one of the man's ears in a jar.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Marnie nodded &#8220;Yes, we must be very careful,&#8221; she said, staring at Maitland. &#8220;You have never explained how you fit in. You seem to have been spying on us and you know more about what is going on than we do. I bet if you wanted you could just get us to Dad and let us all go home. But you have something more devious in mind, don't you.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Marnie, chill out,&#8221; Matt said. &#8220;We have no reason to be mean to him.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;I never trust men wearing shiny suits,&#8221; said Marnie.</p>
            <p>Maitland pondered Marnie's challenge for a moment or two. &#8220;You don't have to trust me if you don't want to. I can't get you to your dad, but I can get you into the New East India Trading Company headquarters so you can see them for yourselves.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Rob flinched, &#8220;I've just been there. They didn't let me look around much, but there seemed to be papers and plans all over the church. They were using it as an office. I did wonder what all that stuff was.</p>
            <p>&#8220;We have to go,&#8221; Matt said. &#8220;Finding Dad by chance among zillions of random universes is not going to happen. If these trading company guys know anything about him then we need to know it too.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Agreed,&#8221; added Marnie. &#8220;Maitland, take us to the trading company.&#8221;</p>
