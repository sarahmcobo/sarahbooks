            <p class="texttop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he next day.</p>
            <p>Lothsen started to come to his senses after travelling with Maitland and Hector to the universe of gold. For Lothsen it was like waking up and still being in a dream, as his eyes began to take in the glorious views of the riches all around him. The waking dream was cut short as Lothsen was roughly turned onto his front with his face pushed into the soft brown dirt of the graveyard. His left arm was twisted behind his back, the pain increasing as his hand neared the back of his head.</p>
            <p>Lothsen’s first reaction was to look to his two minders who always travelled with him. To his left and right his men were being subjected to the same treatment. His burly Mongol thugs were both being tied in up similar unpleasant positions. They would be of no help.</p>
            <p>Hector struggled to his feet. Seeing someone pinning down his captor, he reached for Marnie. However, his legs had not yet become his own after the trans-universe travel and he fell back clumsily to the ground.</p>
            <p>Marnie looked up to see Jessica smiling down at her. Was this a good thing or had she made another mistake by trusting this woman?</p>
            <p>Maitland appeared from behind Marnie and was the first to speak. &#8220;There you go Jess. All wrapped up just like you asked.&#8221; he said, nodding towards Lothsen and his men. The men holding Lothsen and the Mongols down in the dirt were obviously friends of Maitland’s and looked to him for instructions. &#8220;What do you intend to do with them now?&#8221;</p>
            <p>Jessica kicked Lothsen’s DNA modulator well out of his reach and began to set up her own. &#8220;Well done Maitland, I knew I could count on you and your friends. Just hang on to the thugs for a few minutes. Lothsen and I are going on a little trip.&#8221; She nodded for the man holding Lothsen to step away and she initiated her modulator. Jessica Smythe and Kane Lothsen vanished to another universe.</p>
            <p>Hector was ecstatic to see Marnie safe. Marnie was relieved to learn that all the family were accounted for and probably fine, provided that Sylvia, Matt and Rob had gone home and stayed there as instructed.</p>
            <p>&#8220;What is the plan, Maitland?&#8221; Marnie asked him. &#8220;You seem to have changed allegiances? Did Jessica talk you into this?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;My allegiance has always been to myself, no changes made.&#8221; he responded. &#8220;I owed Jess a favour, that’s all. Now she and I are square. What she does with Lothsen is up to her.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Marnie then told her father all about her experiences in the various universes and her work infiltrating the New East India Company. Hector was most impressed. Only then did Marnie start to tell Hector that her meddling with instrumentation in his laboratory caused all this mess in the first place.</p>
            <p>&#8220;What do we do with these guys?&#8221; asked one of Maitland’s friends who was struggling with his captive.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Let them go.&#8221; said Maitland. &#8220;With Lothsen out of the picture, you two are</p>
            <p>free to do what you want. Finding a better job with a nicer boss would be my</p>
            <p>advice.&#8221; The two goons were allowed to get up and after a bit of aggressive posturing the two men became intoxicated by the visions of gold, silver and jewels all around them and wandered off.</p>
            <p>&#8220;What is happening?&#8221; Marnie asked Maitland again. &#8220;Where has Jessica gone with Lothsen? Can Dad and I go home now?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;You had best wait for Jess to return and explain things. I’m not sure what she is up to and I would like to find out as well.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="centered">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
            <p>Once again Kane Lothsen was dizzy, semi-conscious and with his face in the dirt and his arm being pulled painfully up his back. Jessica had been smart, she had sent another of Maitland's friends on ahead to this universe to await their arrival. Her instructions had been simple, wait for two people to arrive. When they did, detain the fat man with any force deemed necessary.</p>
            <p>Jessica stood over him. &#8220;Stay on your belly Lothsen, like the worm that you are. By the way, welcome to your new home.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Lothsen remained prostrate on the ground as instructed but looked around as best he could, attempting to determine what sort of universe he was in now. It was certainly less attractive than the last one. They were no longer in a graveyard. There was no church next to them, no buildings of any kind. He could see grasslands around and the view to the river was broken only by clumps of trees and bushes here and there. It could be the wilds of Africa rather than Cambridge.</p>
            <p>Maitland's friend kept a keen eye on Lothsen as he walked over to Jessica. &#8220;I know how much you like movies,&#8221; said Jessica from a safe distance. &#8220;Every good pirate film includes a scene where someone gets marooned on a desert island. Well this universe is your desert island. This universe is devoid of humans. I don't know what happened to cause that, maybe our ancestors all killed each other off thousands of years ago, or were eaten by lions. I've had a little look around. I think you will be able to survive here, just like Robinson Crusoe managed it. There seems to be plenty of fruit and vegetables growing naturally for you to graze on. The river water looks clean enough to drink, but I haven't tried it myself.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Jessica continued, &#8220;Keep watching for passing boats, or rather travellers. Out of the infinite number of universes the chances of someone stumbling on this one again with a DNA modulator to pick you up are pretty slim, but it leaves you a dream to cling to, doesn't it?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;So long, Kane Lothsen.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; Lothsen cried out as she was preparing the modulator to leave. &#8220;Whatever you think of me, this is not the sort of person you are. Leaving me here to die will ruin you and everything you stand for. If you do this, how will you be able to stand up in front of others and convince them you are righteous and deserving of their good will?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Let me worry about my conscience.&#8221; Jessica replied.</p>
            <p>Lothesen was now on his feet. Maitland’s friend positioned himself between them ensuring Lothsen could not make a grab for the modulator. Lothen said, &#8220;Of course an intelligent, learned woman like you will have read enough history to know that the best method or system always triumphs in the end. Your way and mine are just different paths. You are right in that it is not up to me to decide the fate of the multi-verse that we have stumbled upon. But, neither is it your right. You are no better than me, pushing your opinion about trade on the universes. Allow history to judge who is right. If my system is wrong then following the rules of Darwinian evolution, it will die out or develop into something better. You must let evolution take its course. The choice is not for you to make. You can’t leave me here.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Jessica. &#8220;If you want a fair fight, your monopoly versus my</p>
            <p>open system, fine. We’ll battle it out and let history decide. Consider this</p>
            <p>my first punch!.&#8221; With that she hit a button on her modulator leaving Lothsen</p>
            <p>very, very alone.</p>
    <p class="centered">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
            <p>Hector and Marnie watched as Jessica and a friend of Maitland's materialised on the ground not far from where Jessica had disappeared from a few minutes earlier. Jessica came towards Hector and Marnie, &#8220;I am so, so sorry for dragging you and your family into this mess. We'll return to the New East India Company universe, get your DNA modulator, and then you both can go home and join the rest of your family.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Where is Lothsen?&#8221; asked Hector, &#8220;Will he still be chasing me?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Don't worry about him. He won't be disturbing anyone for the foreseeable future.&#8221; replied Jessica. &#8220;Let's get you two home.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Jessica, Maitland, Marnie, Hector and the others left the dazzling gold universe behind. Maitland found it particularly difficult to leave. Once in the dank universe of the New East India Company headquarters they searched Lothsen's office for Hector's DNA modulator. While Hector and Marnie were thanking Jessica, Maitland sloped off into the next room.</p>
            <p>Having found the modulator, Hector started setting it up. Marnie decided to find Maitland to say goodbye, it seemed odd to just leave without saying anything. Stepping out of Lothsen's office, she heard Maitland's voice in a loud whisper somewhere close. Looking around, she guessed it was coming from down the gallery and around the corner. As she approached, his words became distinguishable. What she heard made her turn immediately.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Marnie, let's go.&#8221; called Hector. She ran back to stand by her father as he prepared to flip the switch and take them home.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Yes, quickly, and dad, I need to tell you what I just heard Maitland saying.&#8221; Marnie whispered to her dad so Jessica couldn't hear.</p>
            <p>Hector looked at Marnie and frowned, whispering back, &#8220;This isn't over is it?&#8221;</p>
            <p>Marnie nodded negatively, &#8220;Maybe not but at least we'll all be together. Let's go.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Hector pressed the button on his modulator and took them home.</p>
    <p class="centered">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
            <p>In a small chamber of the old church, Maitland gathered his two best pals from the White Swan pub. Mark and Paul sat on chrome bar stools which had been taken from the remains of a nearby club in the destroyed New East India Company headquarters universe. A lone shaft of light passed through one of the few intact stained glass windows. Illuminated by the beam was Martland, surrounded by swarms of dust particles which had floated through the building for hundreds of years.</p>
            <p>&#8220;What now?&#8221; asked Paul. &#8220;I do believe we have an opportunity with Lothsen out of the picture. I'm just not sure what it is? Any ideas?&#8221;</p>
            <p>Maitland replied, &#8220;Yes, this may have turned out better than I had imagined. Here is what we do. Lothsen was trying to control trade - he is a fool. There is no trade to control or profit from. Lothsen was banking on something that may not even be possible. However, if he convinced himself it could be done then it shouldn't be difficult to convince others. All we need is a credible story and investors will come shower us with money.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;I like it.&#8221; said Mark. &#8220;Why go to the trouble of actually producing something when there is more money to be made through people investing in just the idea of it! All these universes may be new to us, but human nature hasn't changed has it?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Yeah, but how do we convince anyone trade is possible if it isn't, and how would people pay us even if they wanted to? There is no inter-universe currency, is there?&#8221; said Paul.</p>
            <p>Outside, the sun went behind a cloud leaving Maitland in shadow where before he had been a beacon of light. &#8220;The lack of an inter-universe currency is yet another opportunity for us, possibly bigger than the trade thing if we get it right. Imagine being the central bank for not just one country, but for many universes. As for a credible demonstration of inter-universe trade, I think I know what to do. That Marnie girl is a tricky one. She told Lothsen that her dad gave here the whale necklace which was able to be moved between universes. She lied about that. It was Jerome, a tall black man with a penchant for big hats that gave it to her. I saw him them, but didn't say anything because I wanted to see what Marnie was up to. Jerome is the key and Marnie is the way to get to him.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Just then the three of them heard someone shuffling outside their little room.</p>
    <p class="centered">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
            <p>The spring sunshine of the family's home universe felt unusually warm and bright as Hector carried a tray of drinks to an outside table at the Eagle Pub. Sylvia had one arm around Matt and was holding Marnie securely with the other. Rob sat across the table, excitedly retelling one story after another from their inter-universe adventures. Hector smiled at them as he distributed soft drinks to the kids, white wine to Sylvia and a pint of cider to Rob. The family had just been reunited and Hector decided the Eagle was the perfect place to catch up and try to figure out what had happened to them all. The excitement and emotion around their table was electric with everyone clamouring to get a word in edgewise. Slowly the pieces started to fall into place.</p>
            <p>Only Marnie seemed quiet and a little reserved. Finally Hector asked her. &#8220;What did you hear Maitland saying just before we returned?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;I couldn't see them, but I heard three men talking, one was Maitland. I didn't recognize the voices of the other two, but they had Maitland's accent, they probably all came from the same place. They called each other Paul and Mark. Maitland was obviously in charge, telling the others that he saw Jerome giving me the necklace in the universe of gold. He is convinced that the man with the big hat is the key. They are going to go after him now. They think I am the key to getting him for some reason.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;We shouldn't have ignored the enigmatic Jerome.&#8221; said Sylvia. &#8220;I wish we understood him. Maitland might be right that Jerome is the key to something about those universes.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Hector put down his glass and chipped in, &#8220;Jerome must have some way of modulating his own DNA. Some mystic, yogi people in our universe claim to be able to control their own heartbeat, perhaps Jerome does something like that but on a different scale?&#8221;</p>
            <p>Matt leaned forward and said to Marnie, &#8220;You said you wanted to make a difference in the world and to change something. You certainly have.&#8221;</p>
