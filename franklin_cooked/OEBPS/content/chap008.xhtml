<p class="chapterIntro">Arthur Compton of Cavendish Laboratories was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics 1927 for demonstrating that scattered quanta (free electrons) have less energy than the quanta of the original beam which illustrates the particle concept of electromagnetic radiation.</p>
<p><br/></p>
            <p>&#8220;This travelling is not getting any easier,&#8221; Matt gasped, staggering to his feet on the roof terrace of Great St. Mary's Church and heading for a window. &#8220;This is encouraging. Look outside: this version of Cambridge is not the dismal dump of a universe we were just in.&#8221; Matt was looking directly below, two hundred feet down, when a family of Chinese tourists floated by in a vehicle, hovered in the air beside him, took photos of the church tower, then flew off.</p>
            <p>&#8220;That is cool!&#8221; said Rob, just catching sight of the car as it flew out of sight. &#8220;Flying cars, what a great universe.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Marnie was now up off the floor. &#8220;Where is Maitland? Did he decide not to come with us?&#8221; she asked Jessica.</p>
            <p>&#8220;It would appear he had other, more pressing engagements&#8221; Jessica responded. &#8220;Nothing to be concerned about, he often does.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Rob went back to gawking at the flying cars.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Those flying cars are completely normal here. About one hundred years ago a man here discovered a form of energy which is much better than the energy sources you have in your home universe. It has made all sorts of inventions possible. Follow me, we are going down the stairs and outside.&#8221; said Jessica.</p>
            <p>Marnie whispered to Matt, &#8220;If ever there was a 5-foot-2-inch, fifty-year-old, white haired tornado, this woman is it. Is she bossy or what?&#8221; Matt nodded in full agreement.</p>
            <p>Out on the street, Marnie, Rob, and Matt followed Miss Smythe to the market square. As in their home universe, vendors used their tiny spaces under canvas awnings to trade in fresh vegetables, Union Jack boxer shorts, war memorabilia, and wine bottle decorations made from tin cans. Marnie gravitated quickly towards a Jamaican man selling t-shirts and colourful, knitted Rastafarian hats. She particularly liked the t-shirt with the slogan: &#8220;If we aren't supposed to eat animals, why are they made out of meat?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;It is odd,&#8221; said Marnie to Jessica Smythe, &#8220;the different universes we have been in are not as different from each other as I might have expected. Wouldn't you think that the market square would be somewhere else, or not exist at all? At least the t-shirts would have different jokes printed on them? I would have thought, in some universes, people would have two heads or something.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;I know what you mean,&#8221; Jessica replied. &#8220;I have visited eleven universes including this one. As you say, there are more similarities than differences. It seems that there are so many forces at work in moulding a society that one difference, even something as significant as a free and unlimited power source, usually gets lost in the mix. However, two of the eleven universes I've seen were completely different. There seems to be a tipping point, and when that line is crossed Cambridge and the people living here are completely different from the Cambridge in your home or mine.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Tell us more about the unlimited energy,&#8221; said Rob.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Have you heard of Nikola Tesla in your home universe?&#8221; asked Miss Smythe. &#8220;He was born in 1856 and in this universe lived to the age of 90. He did some brilliant work in the fields of electricity and electromagnetism.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Yes, he lived in our universe too,&#8221; answered Rob, &#8220;He invented high voltage electrostatic machines and some sort of weird power plants. If I remember correctly, he went a bit over the edge in his later years and despite some signs of brilliance was pretty much denounced as a mad scientist.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Marnie interrupted, &#8220;Look at that wicked red and yellow hat. I want to try it on. But nobody in this universe can see us.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Hello my friends, how can I help?&#8221; sang out the Jamaican stallholder.</p>
            <p>Jessica gave a small gasp as Marnie asked to try on the hat, which did look good on her, but she decided not to purchase it as she wanted to avoid currency complications, as happened with the ice cream.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Do you fly back and forth to Jamaica for your hats and shirts?&#8221; Rob enquired of the friendly salesman.</p>
            <p>&#8220;I could, but I have them delivered to me here now. I used to travel all over the world. At first it was exciting, but nowadays everywhere is pretty much like everywhere else so I mainly stay here with my friends.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;You can't mean that Cambridge, England is just like Kingston, Jamaica?&#8221; quizzed Marnie.</p>
            <p>Jessica had been watching from a short distance away, awestruck that she was watching Matt, Rob and Marnie interacting with a someone of a different universe. When they left the stall she explained, &#8220;Remember, here energy is free, therefore, travel is very cheap. People and goods are much more mobile here than in your universe, so yes, Kingston Jamaica and Cambridge are very much the same in this universe. It is ironic that since travel is so cheap and common, there is actually less of a reason to do it. Almost anything that you would go to Kingston or New York for is available right here in Cambridge. In fact, I don't think places like New York are that interesting anymore either. The ethnic neighbourhoods that give flavour to a city have disappeared, so now New York and most other cities are pretty bland and same-ish. Easy and inexpensive travel has led to a homogeneous world.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; Matt said, &#8220;that I am starting to get the hang of these multiple universes. So even though this universe is more global than ours, as Marnie said, there are more similarities than differences between universes, right?&#8221;</p>
            <p>Miss Smythe responded. &#8220;Yes, that seems to be the case. Something else I have noticed in my travels is that most universes have comparable inventions and technological advances at roughly the same time. Even within one universe it is common for significant advancements and discoveries to be made almost simultaneously by people who didn't even know of each other. Look at powered flight with the American Wright brothers in 1903 and, supposedly, a New Zealand man in 1902. While Charles Darwin was considering publication of his theory of evolution, another man named Wallace developed the same ideas. What is different between universes is whether or not new ideas are accepted and become ubiquitous. Here, Tesla went into partnership with a very wealthy American named Harold Witherspoon. Together they built one hundred power plants that literally suck energy from the air. The electricity produced by these plants they gave away for free. Other wealthy people around the world saw that by donating the cost of a power plant, the good that would come of their money was multiplied many times over. Soon, Tesla designed power plants were common all over the world.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Rob tapped away on his tablet PC for a while. After a moment he said, &#8220;according to the encyclopaedia on this tablet, which is from our home, Tesla sold patents to the Westinghouse Corporation. However, Westinghouse was not interested in giving energy away. They never paid Tesla and never used the patents.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Dad would love this universe,&#8221; Matt said. &#8220;He is always dreaming up new ways to produce power out of ponds full of eels, and all sorts of goofy ideas that never work.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="centered">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
            <p>&#8220;Was Dad ever here with you?&#8221; Marnie asked</p>
            <p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Jessica.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Where is he? What do you know about him? You said you know something.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Let's sit over here on the bench and talk.&#8221; Jessica led the three of them to a quiet corner of the church yard, just out of the market area. The bench itself was modern, made of some sort of carbon-composite material, like a high-tech tennis racket. The strength of carbon material allowed for the bench design to be purely artistic rather than practical: a single 1/4 inch diameter rod of the carbon rose elegantly from the earth, supporting the entire bench and its occupants. From that implausibly narrow trunk, seats splayed out like the petals of a flower.</p>
            <p>Matt was examining the unusual bench. &#8220;I suspect the free, unlimited power in this universe alters the economics of available materials significantly from our universe.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;So do we sit on it or stand around admiring it?&#8221; said Marnie.</p>
            <p>The bench looked very comfortable and we could all sit facing each other unlike traditional straight line benches which are awkward for conversations. Matt snapped a quick photo for his chair collection.</p>
            <p>Marnie glared at Matt, &#8220;What are you doing? Dad is lost and you still photograph stupid seats. I don't believe you!&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Dad would want us to be tourists, enjoying the travelling,&#8221; said Matt defending himself. &#8220;Besides, none of us would be here if you had not,… never mind.&#8221; Rob started fiddling with his tablet looking uncomfortable, as he usually did when Marnie and Matt had a spat. Let's just hear what Jessica has to say.&#8221; Matt slowly and gingerly put his weight upon the fragile looking bench not believing it would hold him, but it did. Rob and Marnie tested the bench and carefully rested themselves on it. Jessica watched with curiosity as she sat down quickly not understanding their apprehension.</p>
            <p>&#8220;I had better start from the beginning,&#8221; Jessica said, now that we were all seated and she had our attention. &#8220;The ability to travel between universes is very new. I don't know of a single universe in which the concept of multiple parallel universes is commonly known or accepted. Certainly the capability and technology to travel between them is very, very rare indeed. However, it would be my guess that in a short space of time such travel will become common. When that happens, there will inevitably be a tremendous sharing of ideas and trading of goods between universes. For example, if you could take unlimited free energy back to your home universe, just think how rich and powerful you would become.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;But, I can do that now!&#8221; said Rob, excitedly jumping up from the carbon-fiber, flower-shaped bench. &#8220;This is amazing!&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Remember a few things; firstly, you three are so far the only people who have been able to communicate directly with people in foreign universes. I recently visited a universe which seemed not to have guns, crime, or war. But because I couldn't talk with anyone I couldn't figure out how this had been achieved, or what I could bring home to make that happen in my universe. Also, you will soon find that it is not possible, as far as we know, to take any physical object from one universe to another. I kept a diary of my travels once, only to find all the pages were blank when I returned home. Photos and anything electronic won't travel home with you either.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;What?&#8221; yelped Matt, &#8220;My photos of this bench were a waste of time?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;More importantly, our photos of the whiteboards at the New East India Trading Company will be lost too. That is a real shame since they seemed to be full of valuable information&#8221; moaned Rob.</p>
            <p>&#8220;I can check that,&#8221; said Matt, scrolling through his photos on the camera. &#8220;She's right. None of the photos we took in the other universes show up. So, what you are saying is that we can only carry home what we remember in our heads?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;That is right. And good luck trying to convince someone to fund the building of a Tesla power plant in your universe based on a story about visiting a parallel universe. They will lock you away in mental institution.&#8221; said Jessica.</p>
            <p>&#8220;How does this lead us to our father?&#8221; said Marnie.</p>
            <p>Jessica continued: &#8220;One of the men of that group known as the New East India Trading Company created a device that allows them to monitor trans-universe travellers. It seems that when someone leaps from one universe to another it creates a very distinctive wave pattern that is fairly easy to track.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;It sure feels like a powerful wave of some sort in my head,&#8221; added Matt, holding his head for greater effect.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Yes, and the East India Company are desperate to learn more about travelling so they can control and profit from it. They track every voyage from one universe to another. At this point, there are very few of us travellers.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;So, did they see Dad travelling?&#8221; Asked Marnie.</p>
            <p>&#8220;They would have, but this story starts before that,&#8221; replied Jessica. &#8220;You see, I managed to get a hold of a travel monitoring tool for a short while, thanks to Maitland. During that time, I was alerted to some of Hector's early experiments. He was not actually travelling at that point, but the wave disturbances were sufficient to register on the device. From that, I guessed that someone in your universe was close to making the jump to inter-universe travel. I went on a visit there to see who it might be and to see if I could somehow get the potential new traveller to see my point of view before the New East India Company got to them.</p>
            <p>&#8220;And, what is your point of view?&#8221; asked Matt, now on the edge of his flower petal seat.</p>
            <p>&#8220;I and a few others believe that it would be a disaster of universal proportions—if you'll pardon the pun—if any one group gains control over trade and travel between universes and exploits that for profit and power. That is exactly what Kane Lothsen wants to do.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;That's the guy Maitland was talking about.&#8221; said Matt?</p>
            <p>&#8220;Kane Lothsen is a nasty piece of work. He founded the New East India Trading Company. He has been gathering followers who share in his desire for domination of new trade routes between universes. To that end he monitors travelers, especially new travellers, with the hope of converting them to his scheme. He primarily needs good scientists. As yet, he can't move goods from one universe to another but it is only a matter of time and science. There is one other thing you should know about Lothsen. His home universe is one of harsh brutality. Slavery is common practice there still and from what I have seen of Lothsen they have little regard for human life.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Marnie stood up. &#8220;So, this Kane Lothsen wants to recruit Dad to the New East India Trading Company?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;'Recruit&#8217; would be putting it nicely,&#8221; said Jessica. &#8220;Lothsen will do whatever it takes to get a genius like your father to work for him. I told you that I happened to have a wave disturbance detector when your dad first conducted an experiment that showed he was on the right track. Although your father might not have even known that his early attempts to create a DNA modulator were working, I did. Crucially, Lothsen did not. As I was saying, I travelled to your universe to watch Rob and Hector for a short time. I needed to get Hector on my side and warn him about Lothsen. I am more limited than you three in that I can not communicate with people in other universes. However, I had heard a theory that some communication is possible through influencing the dreams of people. So that is what I tried. I entered the dreams of both Hector and your mother Sylvia. It took a while, but it must have worked because Hector's progress on the DNA modulator was amazingly fast after that.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Rob pulled the silver stick and Frisbee devices from his backpack and stared at them. &#8220;You mean you told Hector how to build these in his dreams?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;That's right,&#8221; replied Jessica proudly. &#8220;I didn't think it would work, but it did.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;That explains why they don't look like dad's usual cobbled together bits of hardware. You must have more advanced engineering than we do in our universe.&#8221; said Matt, now in awe of the equipment they had been using. &#8220;Hector told me this silver stick was primarily a power pack. Do you mean to tell me I have been carrying a Tesla power generator all this time?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;That's right. It is crucial that Lothsen never finds out that one can manipulate dreams to influence people in other universes. I heard about it quite by chance. If and when Lothsen discovers this, who knows what he might do. My hope is that you can only use dreams to accelerate what someone would accomplish on their own anyway, and not to bewitch a good person into doing bad deeds.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Marnie was now pacing back and forth, her eyes glued on Jessica. &#8220;You got into the dreams of Mum, too? What did you tell her?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;I am not sure how successful I was in influencing her dreams. In any case, the message was not as straightforward as how to build a mechanical device. I tried to get her to dream about the harmful effects of unfair trading relationships. That was probably too ambitious.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; said Marnie, &#8220;but If you have been priming Mum's subconscious for several nights that explains why Mum didn't hesitate to send Rob off after dad so readily. I was surprised that she pressed the button on the modulator and sent him off into the unknown. Now it makes more sense. Dreams or no dreams I doubt if she would have ever allowed Matt and I to go too.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;We should get back home to Mum soon, but you still haven't told us where Dad is.&#8221; said Marnie to Jessica.</p>
            <p>&#8220;I am afraid something went wrong,&#8221; replied Jessica solemnly. I didn't expect Hector to make his first inter-universe trip so quickly. It should have taken months, or at least weeks, to work out the calibrations and settings. How did you two work it out so fast?&#8221; she asked Rob.</p>
            <p>&#8220;We didn't. Hector also estimated that we had several weeks or months of work still ahead of us. But then he suddenly vanished from the lab. Very strange. Have you actually seen him in another universe? Do we know with absolute certainty that he is even out here?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;There is no doubt he is travelling. Maitland has seen him.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;He never told us that!&#8221; said Marnie. &#8220;I knew he was a dodgy character. Where and when did Maitland see Dad?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;I would trust Maitland about as far as I could throw an elephant, but when his own ambitions happen to overlap with mine, he can be a very useful man to know. Maitland told me he met with your father in a universe in which Cambridge had a very strong South American influence and there was a giant red temple just over there,&#8221; said Jessica, pointing at Kings College.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Rob spoke first. &#8220;So Hector was in the same universe as us! He would have been there one day before we were. Wait a minute, we have a &#8216;home universe&#8217; option on our modulator equipment and we used it in the Fitzwilliam museum to go home from the Mayan universe. Hector's modulator and software are identical to ours, why didn't he use it to go home? Maybe he didn't find the signature of the Mayan universe, like we did at the museum?&#8221;</p>
            <p>There was a short pause as they considered Rob's question. Jessica replied, &#8220;I can't explain that. It is possible, of course, that Maitland is not telling me the full story. The point is that Hector is travelling universes and it appears that the New East India Trading Company doesn't know where he is either. Maitland told me that Hector gave them the slip when they tried to escort Hector to the New East India Company headquarters.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Is that all you can tell us about Dad?&#8221; asked a disappointed Marnie. &#8220;You have not exactly showered us with helpful information to locate him and bring him home, have you?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; said Jessica. &#8220;You know as much as I do now. I wanted you to know about the New East India Company, how they want your father's talents and the ability you three have to interact with people in foreign universes. To be honest, I didn't believe it and wanted to see it for myself, too. I also want you to understand that if Lothsen and his New East India people manage to control trade between universes they will be ruthless with the power and riches they gain. You must also understand that there is another way. The Trade Free way that I am pushing for.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Marnie did not look overly impressed. &#8220;I have had enough of being pushed around and led astray. Please go if you can't help us find Dad.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Jessica set up her modulator and left Rob and the twins.</p>
