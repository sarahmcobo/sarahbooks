<p class="chapterIntro">The Nobel Prize in Physics 1915 was awarded jointly to William Lawrence Bragg of Cavendish Laboratories and his father Sir William Henry Bragg "for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays"</p>
<p><br/></p>
            <p>When Matt regained consciousness he groggily considered the wisdom of their rash decision to search for their father, Marnie and Rob were still passed out on the floor. He staggered to his feet and to the small window in the low sloping ceiling of the attic lab room. Looking across Cambridge from the window, he saw the usual spires of the churches and old university buildings. Most of the buildings were of classical architecture from up to 800 years ago, but sprinkled among them were a few ugly constructs from the 1960s. One of the most impressive buildings in the view from this 3rd floor vantage point should have been Kings College Chapel on its prime location beside the river Cam. Matt's mouth fell open like a fish. &#8220;Marnie! Uncle Rob! Are you OK? Get up off the floor, you'll want to see this. Kings College seems to have been replaced with a red Mayan temple. The transfer must have worked, we are in another universe.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Seconds later Marnie staggered to her feet, transforming from comatose to full-on in an instant. Matt couldn't help noticing that she wore a t-shirt emblazoned with the words &#8220;I'm with stupid,&#8221; and an arrow pointing to where Matt would be standing at her side. Rob was more like a grizzly bear slowly emerging from winter hibernation and not yet convinced that getting up was a good idea.</p>
            <p>Marnie searched around the room examining instruments and items on the tables. &#8220;This looks just like Dad's lab to me, except Mum was standing there a minute ago.&#8221; She reached the small window, wiped the grime from a circular patch for a clearer view, and then stepped back as if she had just seen a ghost. &#8220;There is a South American temple in the middle of Cambridge.&#8221;</p>
            <p>By now the hibernating grizzly inside Uncle Rob had pretty much awakened and was as hungry for information as a bear would be hungry for food after a long winter. He lumbered over to join the twins at the window. &#8220;All those theories were right. We really have travelled to another universe, just as your father postulated. Can you imagine the ramifications of this?&#8221;</p>
            <p>Matt had not taken his eyes off the temple since first seeing it. &#8220;You know what is odd, that temple somehow looks as though it fits this English city don't you think? It is quite new and well maintained, not a relic from a thousand years ago like all the temples in the history books.&#8221;</p>
            <p>The three fell into an uncomfortable silence as the importance of what had just happened began to dawn on them. They had gone from home to a place that was almost the same—but not the same.</p>
            <p>&#8220;What do we do now? Is there any sign of dad here? Should there be&#8221; asked Matt, breaking the silence.</p>
            <p>&#8220;We ought to try the mobile modulator,&#8221; said Rob, already starting to assemble the device. He balanced the Frisbee on the stick and gave it a spin.</p>
            <p>Marnie could almost not bear to look. &#8220;What if it doesn't work?&#8221; she said.</p>
            <p>The Frisbee balanced on the stick for the smallest of moments before it fell to the floor, taking Marnie's spirits with it. Then Marnie remembered, &#8220;Don't you have to calibrate something Uncle Rob?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Of course!&#8221; he replied, digging into his backpack for the tablet PC. Within seconds, he was tapping away. The seconds grew into minutes, which seemed like hours. As he typed, Rob's earlier confidence was replaced by a nervous sweat. &#8220;I am not sure how to calibrate it,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;I think we need some settings. It seems we need to know what universe we're in now. It's like reading directions from a map. You need to know where you are starting from. I guess it is like being driven somewhere with a blindfold on. If the blindfold comes off you need to figure out where you are before knowing how to head back.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;We're in the same room we were in before we did the so called travelling,&#8221; said Marnie.</p>
            <p>&#8220;True, but that Mayan Temple out of the window there shows we are not completely in the same place,&#8221; replied Uncle Rob.</p>
            <p>&#8220;So how do we know where we are?&#8221; Matt asked, now feeling guilty that they had not admitted that he and Marnie had stupidly changed the settings on the modulator.</p>
            <p>Rob spoke while reading from the tablet computer's screen, &#8220;The programme is asking for the signature of this universe. To determine that, it needs the point in time, or significant point when the visited universe diverged from the home universe.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Just guessing here, but the Mayan temple would be a good place to start, wouldn't it?&#8221; said Marnie, already at the door. &#8220;What are we waiting for? Let's go.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="centered">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
            <p>Sylvia was now sitting alone in the lab. She had always detested the chair she was sitting in. Hector had chosen it in the bargain isle of a large grocery store while she was busy gathering food for dinner. He said it epitomised style and comfort. She found it cheap and nasty and neither comfortable nor stylish. For these reasons, the chair had been the first piece of furniture to be sent from their flat to the lab. It occupied a prime position in a dusty corner between what looked like the first computer ever made, and a small slightly cracked white sink.</p>
            <p>The lab was full of equipment but devoid of people. Sylvia desperately wanted people, her family to be precise, in the room with her.</p>
            <p>Sylvia thought back to her third year at the university, specifically to a warm spring day much like this one, the day she and Hector first met. She let her mind wander as she often did when frustrated with her research and in search of a diversion from her books. She was not averse to studying or hard work; it was just that her chosen fields of history and anthropology were not living up to her expectations.</p>
            <p>She had wanted to learn what made humans tick, why they did what they did. Why did people continually move and migrate to new, unknown lands that often turned out to be no better than the places they had left? Why are so many of the world's religions similar in so many ways even though they evolved independently? Rather than find answers to those questions, it seemed to Sylvia she was given only endless lists of social events to memorise. She was so frustrated she nearly dropped out of university that year.</p>
            <p>Nowadays Sylvia's usual distraction was searching the internet for curious bits of hardware. She would challenge herself to find something new and think of a use for it, before returning to her studies. Yesterday she found 1476 yards of Kevlar thread for only £19.50. Could this 135-pound tensile strength thread be used to make a giant spider web sculpture in the garden outside the family apartment?</p>
            <p>On a particular spring day many years ago, Sylvia had escaped the drudgery of her books by punting on the river with a few of her girlfriends. They were poetry on the water; pretty girls gallivanting on the river Cam. Sylvia, tall and graceful, was piloting the boat.</p>
            <p>Punts are notoriously difficult to steer so it was not hard for Sylvia to engineer a collision with an oncoming punt containing a brace of handsome young men. Hector was in that boat. The two of them talked late into the night. She told him of her frustrations with anthropology, and he told her of his studies in the new field of DNA frequency mapping. He explained how human genome mapping was interested in just 10% of our DNA, with the rest considered &#8220;junk&#8221; by most biologists. Hector was working on a theory that the 90% resonates in waves, with a frequency that communicates with DNA in other living things. He was hoping to determine whether combined human endeavour is much more powerful because of combined DNA vibrations.</p>
            <p>This sort of science excited Sylvia. She wanted to know more and more. Over the following months, she looked anew at her fields of study and her relationship with Hector grew in many directions. Their twin children, Matt and Marnie, was one of them.</p>
            <p>A loud beep from the apparatus beside her brought her back from her memories. Were her children and brother trying to contact her across other universes? Was it Hector? She sat bolt upright in the ugly chair, keeping a close watch on the machine, bitterly regretting her decision to allow Rob to try to follow Hector.</p>
            <p>There were no further signs from the machine.</p>
            <p>As more time elapsed uneventfully, Sylvia attempted to meditate to calm herself. She practiced but had never mastered meditation. She was far too worried now to relax her mind into it. Instead, she found herself with her laptop open absentmindedly searching the internet for a distracting gadget. She was dreaming up uses for fluorescent, stretchy, worm-like material that can stretch to 15 times its normal length (only £3.95 a metre).</p>
            <p>Should she have told Rob and the kids about Hector's dreams? She and Hector had agreed not to tell anyone when they had started two weeks ago. Hector woke one morning and, as the unsolvable problems of past years unravelled in his mind, he was able to construct a set of mobile modulators in only three days. Hector suddenly and inexplicably knew all the answers. He said it was like a blueprint had been planted in his head overnight. He also knew he had to build two sets, not just one.</p>
            <p>Sylvia had also dreamed: of her family living out adventures in strange new worlds. She had seen her children with a silver walking stick and Frisbee-like object that were somehow related to the adventure. The feeling she had in the morning was one of pride, knowing that her children were growing up and getting unique experiences in these strange and different places. In the dreams, they were all together, but something must have gone terribly wrong. Hector had disappeared without the rest of them.</p>
            <p>Her laptop finished loading another web page. What could she do with a &#8220;home grommeting pack&#8221; It was only £5.75, including tools and 20 grommets. Maybe she could put the grommets into some old bed sheets and make a sail?</p>
    <p class="centered">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
            <p>Uncle Rob, Marnie and Matt piled out of the Old Cavendish laboratory into the sunshine of a glorious spring afternoon. The entrance to the Old Cavendish is an imposing pair of old wooden doors; fifteen feet high and curved at the top to fit under a grand archway. It gave the kind of gravitas one would expect of a building with such a powerful past. Beyond the door, a passageway led to the rear of the building and the street behind; a disappointingly small alley backing on to some flats, rather than a more appropriate boulevard or courtyard. Such is the fate of many grand old buildings built before the city of Cambridge crowded in around them.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Everything looks normal so far,&#8221; Matt noted, as they headed down the street towards the 900-year-old St Benet's Parish Church. Turning the corner, they faced the usual crowds of foreign tourists, shoppers, and university students.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Still normal,&#8221; Marnie added to the commentary when they were a hundred yards further down the street. &#8220;This is a bit like being the first man to walk on the moon, but finding it to be just like the shopping centre in your home town. I feel like we ought to be wearing oxygen tanks or something. I don't think we have actually gone to another universe at all.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Rounding the next corner, the view of the Mayan temple removed any thoughts that they were still at home.</p>
            <p>&#8220;I take it all back,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Who has the oxygen tanks?&#8221;</p>
            <p>Cambridge is blessed with impressive architecture but has no buildings more than four storeys high, apart from church spires. This Mayan temple, however, was on such an altogether different scale that it dominated the city. The bright red pyramid was easily 40 metres high, with steps on all sides. The temple's importance was demonstrated not just by its height and colour, but by the breathing space around it in this otherwise crowded city of narrow twisting streets and densely packed buildings.</p>
            <p>&#8220;What do we do now?&#8221; asked Matt. &#8220;How does this help us get home?&#8221;</p>
            <p>Without a word or even an acknowledgment, Marnie started walking towards the great red building. Matt followed. Uncle Rob battled his simultaneous desires to stay near the imagined security of the lab, and to keep up with them. This gave him an awkward gait, with one leg surging forward and the other dragging behind.</p>
            <p>The three walked in silence, taking in details of their surroundings. Reaching a food-stall at the edge of the tidy, green grass field surrounding the temple, they collapsed onto a handy bench. The bench was one of those made out of recycled plastic bags or something. It was brown and looked sort of like wood, but even with the most casual of glances it was obviously pretending to be something it wasn't. &#8220;These things are never satisfying to sit on. I have a photo of one of these in my collection back home.&#8221; said Matt.</p>
            <p>They sat, watched and listened like the three monkeys.</p>
            <p>The Cambridge of their home would have been crowded on a sunny day, as was this Cambridge. Their home Cambridge had little room for cars, as pedestrians and bicycles ruled the streets. The same was true here. In their Cambridge, people came from all over the world to visit as tourists or to study at the colleges and one could easily count half a dozen different languages being spoken in a five minute walk through the city. The same was true here.</p>
            <p>Marnie spoke first. &#8220;There aren't many people speaking English, are there? I recognise some of the languages, I have heard some English, but not much. Most people seem to be using some language with very long words. It sounds very foreign, certainly not European.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;I noticed that too,&#8221; Matt added. &#8220;Sometimes it sounds Spanish, but it clearly isn't.&#8221; The twins had taken enough holidays around Europe to recognise a European language when they heard one. &#8220;There may be something even stranger though. Has anyone here spoken to you or acknowledged you in any way?&#8221;</p>
            <p>Uncle Rob and Marnie looked at each other. &#8220;Well no, but we are among strangers in a city where most people don't seem to speak our language,&#8221; replied Rob.</p>
            <p>A couple of yards in front of their bench was a college student carrying a sign and trying to sell guided punting trips on the river. These chaps were part of the street furniture in Cambridge. They worked on commission for the firms that hire boats and give the tours, and consequently were invariably more proactive at making sales than your average sign holder.</p>
            <p>Marnie stood and walked up to the young man. &#8220;How much is a guided punt tour?&#8221;</p>
            <p>He ignored her.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Excuse me, my friends and I would like to see the river.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Still no response. He appeared not to even see Marnie, even though she was now six inches in front of him.</p>
            <p>&#8220;We have loads of cash and I'll sunbathe naked on the boat,&#8221; she shouted at him.</p>
            <p>No reaction. Not one of the passers-by noticed her either.</p>
            <p>&#8220;What's going on? Are we really here or just dreaming all this?&#8221; said Matt. To further test his invisibility theory, he walked up to a Japanese tourist laden with cameras and stood right in front of his face. The tourist gave no indication of knowing Matt was there.</p>
            <p>After more shouting and jumping around in the faces of various people, Marnie had gathered all the evidence she needed. &#8220;We are definitely invisible,&#8221; she announced.</p>
            <p>Her mood flipped and she turned on Matt. &#8220;Look what you have done you idiot! You just had to play around with the controls on the machine in Dad's lab. Why couldn't you just leave them alone? Now we are somewhere we can't get back from and we can't even get help from anybody because we don't seem to really exist here. Even worse, Dad is probably somewhere similar to this, but all on his own!&#8221; Marnie was livid with anger.</p>
            <p>Matt was about to politely point out that it was Marnie, not him, that had started all this by fiddling with the controls. Fortunately, Uncle Rob stepped in. &#8220;Stop it you two. We need to come up with a plan and arguing will not help although I would like to know more about this tampering with the equipment. I thought the test of your father's new theory of universe travel just went badly wrong. I didn't know it had been sabotaged.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Uncle Rob is right,&#8221; Matt said. &#8220;What are we going to do?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;As I said before, your dad believed one would need to calibrate the communicator by determining how and when this universe diverged from the universe we came from,&#8221; Uncle Rob replied.</p>
            <p>Marnie was beginning to calm down again. &#8220;Let's find a museum,&#8221; she said.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Brilliant!&#8221; Matt thought to himself, he would never admit it but sometimes Marnie had awesome flashes of inspiration.</p>
            <p>Rob was slower to grasp Marnie's reasoning. &#8220;This is not a time for tourism. Let me try to explain it to you. The theory is that every decision or point at which there are two or more possible outcomes, results in two or more universes. Imagine a short-sighted ant walking down the branch of a tree. He is faced with choices to go left or right as the branch splits into smaller and smaller branches. The branches not selected by the ant do not cease to exist when he takes another path, he just can't see them. The equipment in your Dad's lab is like a strong wind blowing the ant off his chosen branch onto another one he couldn't see. Instead of branches, substitute universes.</p>
            <p>We need to understand the history here in this universe&#8230;&#8221; Uncle Rob's voice trailed away as the light dawned. &#8220;We need a museum!&#8221;</p>
            <p>Marnie and Matt smirked at each other. They were friends again just as quickly as they were enemies a moment before.</p>
            <p>&#8220;School keeps dragging us down to that boring old Fitzwilliam Museum, it is</p>
            <p>full of the most tedious antique junk from&#8230;"</p>
            <p>&#8220;Let's just get going,&#8221; Marnie interrupted.</p>
            <p>The walk was short, less than a quarter of a mile. The pavements were crowded, and as the other pedestrians could not see them, it was entirely the responsibility of Matt, Marnie and Rob to avoid collisions with people. A crowd had gathered at the corner of Benet Street to watch the two-foot-tall, mechanical gold grasshopper type thing stepping over a large circular clock mechanism built into the wall. This mechanical sculpture was Marnie's favourite thing in Cambridge. She stopped to watch it, as she had many times before.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Why the heck do you like that thing so much?&#8221; Matt asked his sister.</p>
            <p>&#8220;I don't know, there's just something oddly comforting about a mechanical grasshopper walking over a clock, don't you think? Anyway, you have your very odd chair fetish. That is so much stranger than liking a mechanical, timekeeping grasshopper.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Hold on there. Chairs are probably the most fascinating and underrated works of functional artwork that mankind has ever created. Just think, they serve only one purpose, something to sit on, but look at the variety of designs that have been created over millennia and across all cultures on the planet. Chairs are one of the best measures of mankind that exist. Look at&#8230;"</p>
            <p>&#8220;Enough, enough!&#8221; cut in Rob, just as Matt was losing himself in his pet subject. &#8220;Remember, we are perhaps the first humans ever to jump to another universe, apart from your dad and yet you are obsessing about grasshoppers and chairs!&#8221;</p>
            <p>Having been put squarely in his place Matt looked back up at the wall. &#8220;Have you spotted the difference yet?&#8221; he asked, looking higher up the wall over the grasshopper.</p>
            <p>Matt directed Marnie's gaze up to another sculpture, a new one on this familiar street corner. They were looking at an angular, geometric, five-foot granite serpent whose tail blended into a lightning bolt. Between the serpent and the grasshopper, an artist of lesser talent had spray-painted a blue circle around the number &#8220;20&#8221; on a granite building.</p>
            <p>&#8220;That serpent was probably made by the same people who put the temple here,&#8221; said Uncle Rob.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Duh!&#8221; said Marnie. &#8220;And what about that graffiti circle, Uncle Rob? What people created that great masterpiece?&#8221;</p>
            <p>Just as Uncle Rob was about to step out into the road to avoid another camera pointing Japanese tourist, a cyclist sped towards him. Uncle Rob leapt back onto the pavement right into the Japanese photographer. &#8220;Aaahhhh, I went right through that guy! That was just too weird, did you see that? It was horrible!&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;You mean, we are not only invisible to these people, we are not physically even here? I don't like the sound of that at all. We have to avoid these crowds,&#8221; cried Marnie, her skin crawling.</p>
            <p>&#8220;We should cross the street, it doesn't look as crowded over there,&#8221; said Matt, weaving between bicycles on the road.</p>
            <p>A few minutes later they were staring up at the classical Greek facade of the Fitzwilliam Museum. It was one of the larger structures in Cambridge, with fourteen towering, capital-topped columns all under the perfectly formed triangular roof section. It looked much like the Parthenon Acropolis of Athens, which is exactly how an important structure should look to a European eye.</p>
            <p>&#8220;I wonder why this museum uses Greek architecture and not Mayan?&#8221; Matt mused ascending the steps. Nobody could answer.</p>
            <p>&#8220;What are we looking for?&#8221; said Marnie as they entered the museum. &#8220;Hey, I guess we don't have to pay to enter if we are invisible. That's one thing we have going for us!&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;It is free admission anyway.&#8221; said Matt.</p>
    <p class="centered">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
            <p>&#8220;They could have made a bit more effort with the interior design here,&#8221; Matt said as his eyes slowly adjusted to the relative darkness.&#8221; The entrance to the Fitzwilliam museum was dark. Not dark as in the lights are turned off, just dark from all the heavy hardwood used to construct the two large staircases, walls and floors, and dark from a lack of windows. Compared to the bright spring sunshine outside it was like being in the blazing heat and light of the Egyptian desert and then descending into the dark depths of a stone pyramid.</p>
            <p>&#8220;What a creepy place,&#8221; added Marnie. &#8220;Which door do we go in through?&#8221;</p>
            <p>Across from where they stood at the entrance was a large, curved desk behind which sat three members of staff. Their purpose was unclear to Matt, Marnie and Rob as well as to the several small groups of tourists milling around in the gloomy entrance hall.</p>
            <p>Matt, Rob and Marnie headed between the groups of tourists towards a pair of glass double doors at the back of the lobby. To their left was a group of what looked like German businessmen. To their right were half a dozen college students, each armed with large sheets of art paper and coloured pencils. Ahead of them was a family, probably local Cambridge residents judging by their absence of maps, cameras, and guidebooks. They consisted of a mum, a dad, a toddler of about three years old, and a baby in a pram. They were blocking the glass door while the mum dug about in the undercarriage of the pram looking for a wet wipe or some other vital parenting tool. Marnie was in the lead and was about to stop and wait for the family to finish their business when the baby pointed directly at her and began gurgling, laughing and making faces. Without thinking Marnie screwed her mouth into a ball and replied with baby talk, causing the baby to giggle even harder. Soon Marnie was dancing for the baby's entertainment.</p>
            <p>Uncle Rob and Matt watched in confusion. The baby's family paid no attention and made no sign of acknowledgment to Marnie while she amused their child. After a bit Marnie became suddenly aware she was interacting with another human from this strange universe who could apparently see and hear her. Just to check, she asked the baby's mother if she had the time. The baby continued to follow Marnie's movements, but the mother was oblivious to her. Soon the family proceeded through the doors and into the main hall of the museum.</p>
            <p>&#8220;It just gets weirder and weirder,&#8221; Matt said. &#8220;Why can some people here see us and others can't?&#8221;</p>
            <p>They followed the family through the doors. &#8220;Where do we start, genius,&#8221; said Marnie to her Uncle Rob.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Well, we are looking for the big difference between our universe and this one. So, what's in this museum now that wasn't here the last time you were here? Didn't you say you came here with your school just a couple of weeks ago? What has changed?&#8221; Rob asked Matt.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Actually, I was not on my best academic form on that day, at least my prime focus was not on history, I just couldn't concentrate.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;The distraction was not anything to do with Becky Whitehouse was it? I have heard talk at school about you two.&#8221; Marnie dived in with the attack.</p>
            <p>&#8220;I wish it had been. Becky is pretty cute.&#8221; Matt was learning that surprise was often the best defence against Marnie. Throw her off balance, was the advice Mum gave him after one extremely heated discussion.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Let's just get looking,&#8221; responded Marnie, giving in to Matt this time.</p>
            <p>They wandered through the museum looking for something different from the exhibits they would see at home. They saw old pottery, old paintings, and old statues. Nothing was of much interest until they reached the South American section. &#8220;I don't remember this room being here,&#8221; said Matt as they gazed around the displays. He saw stone carvings of women with large headdresses, and a bathtub of the same stone with gory battle scenes carved into the sides.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Look at this mask.&#8221; called Marnie. &#8220;Scary looking or what? The sign says it's made of turquoise, and look at those teeth, they look like real human teeth to me.&#8221; She was transfixed by the stare from what looked like a turquoise mummy face. The face itself was made from hundreds of tiny pieces of turquoise somehow stuck onto a skull, the eyes were like large black marbles. The skull held a shocked expression for the two thousand years since it had been crafted.</p>
            <p>Rob had been in his own world, studying a plaque on the wall next to a stone sculpture of a squatting human-like figure. &#8220;I think I've found it. Have a read of this,&#8221; he said.</p>
            <p>The plaque was much like all the others in the museum. A simple card, white with black lettering, not framed, but slightly raised off the wall. It read as follows:</p>
            <p class="simulate_blockquote">In the year 1436 the renowned adventurer Quauhtli Coatl set off from the coast of what is now Venezuela with a small fleet of sailing vessels. Later in the same year he and his crew landed in Europe for the first time, near the Portuguese city of Lisboa (Lisbon).</p>
            <p class="simulate_blockquote">Coatl's journal states that he found the natives to be &#8216;exceedingly poor, badly educated and lacking in morals of any kind.&#8217;</p>
            <p class="simulate_blockquote">Over the next decade the powerful Tenochca (Mayan) empire, which had enlightened almost all of Central and South America, extended its reach to all the backward peoples of Western Europe. Initially, military force was required as the European natives of the time could not see the advantages offered by the Tenochca culture. Two hundred ships were sent across the Atlantic carrying the forces necessary. By 1439, the countries of Southern Europe were liberated from their past. In the following years, the rest of Western Europe joined the new way. These are known as Europe's years of enlightenment.</p>
            <p><br/></p>
            <p>After reading, Marnie said, &#8220;What happened to Christopher Columbus discovering America and the Spanish invading over there?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;It would appear that, in this universe, the South Americans discovered Europe before Columbus discovered them.&#8221; Replied Rob.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Columbus sailed in 1492. That would have been about fifty years too late if</p>
            <p>this plaque is correct,&#8221; Matt said. &#8220;It would also explain that big, red</p>
            <p>temple out in the city. If the Mayans, or <em>Tenocha</em> as this seems to call them, discovered and conquered Europe before we got to them, well&#8230; that would explain this universe, wouldn't it?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;It sure would.&#8221; Rob was already digging into his backpack for the mobile modulator. He soon had it set up again and he entered the information they had just learned. This time the Frisbee balanced nicely on the walking stick: apparently spinning, but at the same time looking like it was not moving at all. With his tablet computer in hand, Uncle Rob tapped away, looking hopeful. &#8220;Your dad was a genius! This gizmo just needs to know about the Mayan versus Europe thing, the date, and it manages to figure out the rest of what it needs to know. That's it. We should be able to go home. Ready?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Yes, let's go,&#8221; Marnie and Matt chimed in unison.</p>
            <p>Rob tapped the tablet. They began to feel dizzy and the room started to spin.</p>
            <p>The silver Frisbee turned a deep bluish purple colour, such a fully saturated colour none of them could ever have imagined. The three were completely transfixed as they stared into the surface of the Frisbee which now seemed to have infinite depths, mesmerised by the spinning worlds of colour within the Frisbee.</p>
            <p>Just as Matt felt he was going to faint, a man in a grey suit emerged from the dark corners of the Mayan room. He walked calmly up to them and said, &#8220;Hello, my name is Maitland.&#8221; Everything then went blank.</p>
