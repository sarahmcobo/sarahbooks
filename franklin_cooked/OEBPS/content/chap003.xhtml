<p class="chapterIntro">Lord Rutherford of Cavendish Laboratories won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1908, "for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances".</p>

    <p class="centered">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
            <p>The smell of dust and dried horse dung nearly overpowered Hector. The source of the odour was the man holding Hector roughly by the arm and leading him down the lower steps of the Mayan temple in the centre of Cambridge.</p>
            <p>Hector was curious by nature, an essential trait for a scientist. He wondered about the big questions in life such as do TV washing powder advertisements really help sell washing powder. Now he had more pressing questions such as why this thug was gripping his arm so hard? He also wondered why not one of the tourists ogling and photographing the temple raised an alarm when he had been grabbed? In fact, he seemed to be invisible. While being chased across the crowded pavements not a single person had made eye contact with him or made any attempt to move out of his way. Who were these men that had chased and caught him and why had they done it? They had not spoken a word to Hector or to each other that he had noticed. Did that make them highly trained efficient, ruthless assassins or simply strong silent types? One thing seemed certain, being taken by these men was not a good thing.</p>
            <p>Hector would have loved a few quiet moments to bask in the glory of his invention. His theories on the atomic vibrations of matter had turned out to be absolutely correct and the device he built back in his lab had actually worked! It had taken him to another universe where the DNA of every living thing oscillated just a little bit differently from the DNA in the home he knew. In the few minutes since having what would surely be Nobel Prize winning work confirmed, he had been running away from a pair of hoodlums. Another unpleasant squeeze on his biceps brought his immediate predicament back into focus. One of the ugly thugs had Hector's power source and modulator, in one of his big hands and Hector's bruised arm in the other. The other thug followed behind. Without the power source, tablet, and the Frisbee shaped device which did the hard work of molecular modulation, Hector would be trapped in this universe. By now he would be missed by his family. His brother-in-law Rob was the only one that might guess correctly about the cause of his disappearance. What would Rob do, what could he do? Hector hoped he would not do something stupid like try to follow him.</p>
            <p>Hector knew he had to do something, almost without thinking he used his thumb to press a red button on the tablet computer which was still in his pocket causing over 150 thousand volts of low amperage electricity to shoot up the arm of his captor from the ski pole power source. The sudden jolt was enough of a shock to cause the man to drop the ski pole and release his grip on Hector. In a flash, Hector grabbed the pole and Frisbee and dashed down the rest of the steps of the temple two at a time.</p>
            <p>Sprinting through a crowd of Chinese tourists brandishing video cameras Hector shot into the tiny St Edwards Passage, crashed through the door of &#8216;The Haunted Bookshop&#8217; and disappeared up the tiny stairs to a small room packed with books. As the two monster men searched the alley, Hector balanced the Frisbee device on the stick with one hand while poking at the tablet computer preparing it to take him to another universe. He couldn't go home yet and risk having the goons follow. He would just head somewhere other than here. Hector heard heavy footsteps running up the cramped staircase just as the modulator came to life. The universe he was headed to was a complete mystery, would it be safer than the one he was in now?</p>
