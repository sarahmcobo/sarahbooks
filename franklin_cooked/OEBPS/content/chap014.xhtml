<p class="chapterIntro">Sir John Cockcroft of Cavendish Laboratories and Ernest Walton received the Nobel Prize in Physics 1951, "for their pioneer work on the transmutation of atomic nuclei by artificially accelerated atomic particles".</p>
<p><br/></p>
            <p>&#8220;Damn,&#8221; said Matt pulling himself up off the floor looking at Rob seated comfortably in Hector's chair laughing at him. &#8220;Why did I have to choose a high stool with no arms?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;You OK?&#8221; Rob asked. &#8220;Let's start by looking for clues here in the lab. You take that end, I'll have a look at the desk and papers.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;You sound just like Fred?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Fred? Who's Fred?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;What were you doing during all those years when you were babysitting Marnie and I in the afternoon's while mum was at classes? We must have watched 300 episodes of Scooby Doo. In each one, there was a point when Fred told the gang to &#8216;split up and look for clues.&#8217; You must remember.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Ah, it must have been there in my subconscious all right. Those were fun times. I'm surprised you and Marnie are not more balloon shaped after all the popcorn you forced me to make for you. It shut you up for hours on end.&#8221;</p>
            <p>A thorough examination of the lab revealed nothing of interest to their quest so they once again prepared to face the streets of Cambridge - but which Cambridge? A quick look out of the small window had revealed little. All the buildings appeared to be in their correct places. There were neither Mayan temples nor did the city look as though it had been bombed. Only the weather had changed: a not untypical grey day awaited.</p>
    <p class="centered">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
            <p>&#8220;Yuk, get me out of here NOW!&#8221; Marnie scrambled and twisted, trying to free herself from the arms, legs and odours of her captors.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Sorry about that dear, just one of the risks of travel, I'm afraid,&#8221; said Lothsen.</p>
            <p>Immediately after the kidnapping, Marnie awoke on the floor of the lab in a tangle with the two malodorous thugs of the New East India Trading Company. Lothsen was standing above them. The fragrant bodyguards piled around her had not yet recovered from their inter-universe trip.</p>
            <p>&#8220;This is not a good start,&#8221; she scowled at Lothsen. &#8220;The last thing I remember you saying was that you would take good care of me. Have you sent your goons to take a bath in the last few months?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;They come from a universe that has rather less emphasis on hygiene than you are apparently used to. I shall point them to a shower, but I doubt they will know what to do in it. They are very loyal though. They also seem to like the nice suits I dress them in.&#8221;</p>
            <p>The two muscle men were now standing up, but still too groggy to know they were being talked about.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Let's be off then fellows. I've got places to go, people to see and all that.&#8221; Without glancing back, Lothsen strode out of the lab. Marnie did not initially follow him, but as the two malodorous ones approached her she gave up on this form of subtle protest and headed down the stairs to the streets of Cambridge.</p>
            <p>&#8220;I had forgotten how depressing this universe was,&#8221; Marnie said to nobody in particular as they were walking the empty streets of the bombed version of Cambridge that Lothsen had selected as a base for his operations. The four of them marched single file towards the headquarters in the main church beside what was the market square. Lothsen was in the lead, one of the thugs walked in front of Marnie, the other behind her. This formation allowed Marnie to have a good look at the smelly thug in front of her. His shaved head was perched on an unfeasibly thick neck and broad back. He was dressed in a well-fitting business suit, blue with pinstripes, similar to the one Lothsen wore but not of the same quality. Marnie thought how impressive it was that such a suit could even be constructed to fit over the massive, muscular body of its inhabitant. The party passed the display window of an old department store. The mannequins modelling swimwear were far past their primes, but there was quite a bit of glass still left in the storefront window. Marnie watched in surprise as her minder turned to the glass and struck several poses, whether he was admiring his physique or the cut of his suit—Marnie couldn't be sure. Either way, this thug who had hardly spoken a word in her presence was clearly proud of his appearance. He turned to see her watching him. Embarrassed, he scowled, grunted and waved his arms at her in a threatening manner.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Get over here you two.&#8221; Lothsen commanded his men. He led the two just out of earshot from Marnie, but near enough that they could keep an eye on her. &#8220;Don't either of you dare forget for one minute what I told you and the others. You will treat Marnie like a queen. The goal is to have her father working with us and if we mistreat her he'll be less willing. I'd love to torture him into developing the new science of inter-universe travel, but even I will admit that the last scientist was not very useful after we cut off his ear.</p>
            <p>Lothsen walked back to Marnie, &#8220;We have a lot to talk about.&#8221; his words took her mind off the thug and his vanity.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. What did you say your name was again?&#8221; said Marnie. She was rapidly trying to think of ways to keep Kane out of his stride. There was a spy show on TV she had seen once where they taught spies techniques to deal with interrogation. One method was to keep the interrogator out of their normal routines. Pretending she had forgotten the name of an egotistical man like Lothsen seemed like a good start. What were the other tools of the spy trade she might use? Mum had always told her to stop wasting time watching so much TV. If she could use those hours in front of the tube to get her out of this situation, she would make mum apologise for all that moaning about her TV time.</p>
            <p>&#8220;My name, you forgetful little girl, is Kane Lothsen. You would be wise to remember that. Soon my name will be known across the universes. On the other hand, Lothsen the Benefactor&#8217; has a nice ring to it too, don't you think?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Lothsen the Cute sounds better to me. I couldn't help but notice your hairdo is kind of cute.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Marnie hoped she had not gone too far with her anti-interrogation strategy.</p>
            <p>The site of what should have been the Cambridge Tourist Information office was now a large pile of dirt and rubble. Marnie estimated it at 30 metres long by 20 metres wide. &#8220;What happened there?&#8221; She asked.</p>
            <p>Lothsen replied, &#8220;According to the records I found, that is the burial site of at least 300 people. This universe has a fascinating history. I am a student of history, which is how I have managed to rise above my humble beginnings.</p>
            <p>In the big picture, this universe was similar to mine. The economy depended on what I believe you would refer to as slavery. In fact, my first job was as a slave boss. For the first few weeks, my arm would ache every night from whipping those lazy workers into shape, but I loved it.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;How can you claim to want to improve the worlds when you behaved like that?&#8221; said Marnie. &#8220;That's disgusting.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;The problem with you and most people who don't study like I have is that you only see things through your own little, insignificant viewpoint. Most cultures in history in most universes have one type of man brutalising another type of man. Some call it slavery, others call it an economic system. Either way, the poor work hard, the rich enjoy the good life and those in the middle kick those below them on the ladder.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;I for one am not convinced.&#8221; said Marnie. &#8220;If the slave system is so good, what happened in this universe? It looks to me like it all went wrong.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;It only took a little digging in the last few weeks of newspapers that I could find in the remains of the library to figure that out. An intriguing saga indeed. The slaves were collected from Africa and South Asia then brought to Europe and the Americas. There were hundreds of firms of all sizes involved in this in all parts of the world. The interesting thing in this universe is that the price of slaves sold everywhere was determined by one central system running in London. It had been developed and improved upon over 10 years. It took data inputs from a multitude of sources including economic data, sales forecasts, storms on the oceans, health and epidemics in Africa, crop failures in India, everything. Out of this it created a daily price for the buying and selling of slaves. Any traders not keeping to the price were ostracised.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;So,&#8221; said Marnie, &#8220;what went wrong?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;It seems that over the years the algorithms in the system became so complicated that nobody actually knew what they were doing anymore. One year there were a series of fierce sandstorms in the Sahara that ravaged the area for months. Analysts are not sure, but they think that may have been what made the slave pricing system unstable. It was giving out low prices one day, then very high ones the next. Traders started hoarding slaves waiting for a high price day causing all sorts of issues in the supply line - like ships of slaves waiting for weeks offshore until a freak high price was sent from London. Of course by then half the cargo might have died. It was chaos apparently.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Surely, people could re-program it or just ignore the pricing and use something else?&#8221; said Marnie.</p>
            <p>&#8220;You would think so, and I'm sure they tried everything. It seems the algorithms and programs were too complex. Many attempts to fix them were made.&#8221; replied Lothsen. &#8220;The problem was there were many cartels and factions involved all taking cuts of profits at various stages of the process that anyone setting their own price upset others and soon these firms behaved more like gangs. Even making a change to the algorithm in an attempt to fix it upset one cartel or the other. Battles spread throughout Europe and America. One thing led to another and years after the initial software glitch the civilised world was in a downward spiral. What we see around us is the result.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Scary,&#8221; said Marnie looking at the wasteland surrounding them. &#8220;This is like one of those &#8216;after the apocalypse&#8217; movies. I expect that somewhere in Cambridge is an action hero and a small band of misfits that have somehow survived living in the sewers or something.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="centered">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
            <p>In another universe, Hector and Sylvia continued on their way across Cambridge. The questions and explanations had stopped for a little while as both were happy to simply enjoy being in each other's company again. Their time apart since the beginning of the universe travelling had not been long, but there had been so much uncertainty, especially from Sylvia's point of view, that it seemed like ages.</p>
            <p>&#8220;The kids told me about being invisible to the people in another universe. It is very unnerving walking the streets constantly having to dodge other people. But, tell me about the universe we are in. What makes it different from ours?&#8221; Sylvia asked as they turned a corner into the market square.</p>
            <p>&#8220;I don't know a lot about it yet, except that I think we can use something here to trap Lothsen and the New East India Trading Company.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;How? I thought you had to figure out what made a universe different from your home universe before you could get home again, or return to it or something like that. That is what Rob seemed to think anyway.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;I thought so too at first,&#8221; said Hector. &#8220;but, it turns out that is only partly right. The mobile DNA modulators are set to return to our home universe at the push of a button, that is not a problem. What we don't know is where we might end up when we choose to travel to a new universe. Those numbers on the doors you thought of to explain it a moment ago are correct, but as yet there is no map, nothing to say that door number two is a universe of unimaginable wealth and happiness and that door number three is a place of death and misery, for example.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;I'd love it if behind door number four was a universe in which the queue you moved to because it was shorter did not suddenly come to a halt as soon as you moved to it. That would certainly be different than where we come from,&#8221; said Sylvia.</p>
            <p>&#8220;I suppose such a universe is possible but exceedingly unlikely&#8221; Hector chuckled. &#8220;I'd love a universe in which there was just one common power adapter for all of your brother Rob's electronic gadgets. My lab is littered with his little cables. But, back to the modulators. Another thing the mobile modulators do is remember where you have been. If you did happen upon a universe where changing queues actually gave you an advantage, your modulator would store the twenty-digit signature of that universe and you would be able to get back to it whenever you want. I can see why Rob misunderstood it though. The home button wouldn't work until you had saved the signature of the current universe.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;OK, but how does this help us to trap Lothsen? For that matter, why do we want to trap this Lothsen person anyway?&#8221; asked Sylvia as they wandered between the stalls of the market.</p>
            <p>A low, sing-song, Afro-Caribbean voice broke into their conversation. &#8220;That Lothsen has a bad soul that is true, but believe me when I tells you, you do not want to tarnish your soul by doing bad things, even to a bad man.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Sylvia and Hector turned. Looking directly at them was a large black man under a bulbous blue and white knitted hat, Sylvia had of course never met Bob Marley, but if someone had told her she was looking at the great man now she would not have questioned it. His skin was black as black could be, the hat on his head was as big as a beehive and presumably full of dreadlocks. In front of him was a table of wooden bead necklaces. He had a small collection of silver jewellery, too. &#8220;Would the lady desire a beautiful necklace to match her lovely smile? A nice looking woman such as yourself deserves an excellent new piece of jewellery, don't you think? May I suggest this one? The humpback whale symbolizes family, and luck. This necklace will bring you good luck, I can feel it.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Hector finally managed to squeeze in a word, &#8220;You can see us?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Yea man, I sees you. The world is a fascinating place, no? I can see you two are a happy couple, but something is missing yes? Your family, perhaps? You have a look of being incomplete, especially you mam, if I may say so. Trust to me, this whale necklace will bring you good luck with your family.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;How can you possibly know that much about us?&#8221; asked a flabbergasted Sylvia.</p>
            <p>&#8220;And how is it you can see and talk with us? Ah, I know, you are not a native of this universe either. You are a traveler like us. Is that right?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;So many questions. Here my lady; the whale necklace is for you, no charge, free, gratis, it is my gift to you. We should walk, walk and talk. Walkin&#8217; is good, man, it allows the brain to move, you know what I mean?&#8221;</p>
            <p>In one fluid movement the humpback whale necklace was around Sylvia's neck, a man from the sunglasses stall next door was recruited to watch over the jewellery stall, and Hector and Sylvia found themselves gently herded away from the market.</p>
            <p>Sylvia whispered to Hector, &#8220;Do meetings like this happen all the time out here in the multiverse, or did I just get lucky on my first universe?</p>
            <p>&#8220;I've found that expecting the unexpected is a solid approach to travelling in the multiverse. Following this guy may be entertaining, enlightening or somewhere in between. But it certainly won't be boring.&#8221; Hector whispered back.</p>
            <p>Sylvia spoke at normal volume now so their guide could hear too. &#8220;These 17th-century brick and stone buildings look just as they do in our home. I find that just a little disturbing. When you travel somewhere new and different it should be&#8230; well, new and different, not this similar to the place you just left.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;How does your mind work, my lady?&#8221; asked the man in the Rastafarian headgear.</p>
            <p>&#8220;What? My mind is just fine, thank you. It is just in a very unusual place right now.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Is it now? It looks to me as though your mind is still very much inside your head and sitting on top of your body. How can that be unusual?&#8221;</p>
            <p>While Sylvia pondered that, Hector took a turn at attempting to get a sensible response from the man. &#8220;My name is Hector Moncrieff. Glad to meet you. And you are?&#8221;</p>
            <p>The black man held out a large fist for Hector. &#8220;Jerome, call me Jerome. And I shall call you Hector the Great for that is what you are and what you shall be.&#8221; Not quite sure how to respond Hector tapped his fist against Jerome's. &#8220;Right on, my good man.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;So much for a simple answer to a simple question.&#8221; Hector whispered to Sylvia when Jerome had turned a corner towards the river slightly ahead of them. &#8220;This guy is way, way out in left field. We should lose him. We have a lot to do without wasting time with this loony.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;I'll second that. Let me try to get rid of him.&#8221; Sylvia whispered back.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Mr. Jerome, I am exhausted at the moment. It has been a very stressful time of late. I can tell that you have a lot of wisdom to share with us, but I feel bad that in my current condition I am unable to take best advantage of all you have to offer. Do you mind if we catch up with you later?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;No problem, my lady, I get you, I get you. You requires some space in your mind. An empty mind is the most beautiful thing in the universe - in all the universes. An empty mind is a vessel which the universe can fill with love. I, Jerome will find you when you are ready.&#8221;</p>
            <p>With that the big black man was gone.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Where did he go?&#8221; asked Hector. &#8220;Did he somehow run around that corner without me seeing him, even though I was looking right at him? Or did he travel to another universe? I didn't see him using any sort of DNA modulator.</p>
            <p>&#8220;I don't know,&#8221; replied Sylvia. &#8220;It's like he just vanished. What do you think about him? Were we right to get rid of him like that?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Who knows? He certainly doesn't fit any of the boxes my mind has been trained to put things into.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;True enough! I don't just need a new mental box for that guy, I need an entire new concept of containers,&#8221; said Sylvia. &#8220;Anyway, you were going to tell me about the universe we are in and how and why we want to trap this Lothsen person. I presume this is all aimed at getting our family together again, correct?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Yes, I have been eluding Lothsen ever since his plans were made clear to me. He thinks I will be able to create a mechanism for the trading of goods between universes. That in itself sounds pretty dangerous. Even worse, Lothsen believes that it is his divine right to control and profit from all such trade. Think of all the power that he would have it he achieves this. I have no idea how, or if, I might be able to help him, but he thinks I can work out the science to move objects from one universe to another. While that would certainly be an interesting challenge to work on, it may not even be possible. If it is possible, I wouldn't want Lothsen controlling the futures of so many people and having that much power.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Sounds reasonable. So if you are hiding from Lothsen, how can Rob and the kids find us here?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;As I said, I have been leaving them clues. My hope is that Rob and the kids will sooner or later start looking for the clues, figure them out and find us here.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;OK, but how does trapping Lothsen come into the picture? One of the things I suspected early on, and Jessica, confirmed it, is that Lothsen's scientists have developed a device that can monitor travel between universes. I managed to reconfigure my DNA modulator so that it can't be monitored. That's how I've been able to evade him. However, my bet is that Lothsen will be tracking Rob and the kids. When they come here to this universe, you can be sure Lothsen will be following them. Then we spring the trap.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;You seem to have turned into a bit of a secret agent while wandering around without me these past couple of days. A boyhood dream being fulfilled perhaps? How will we trap him?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;That is where you come in, dear.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Me? Am I the trap?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;No, you need to figure out what the trap is. You see, I've been busy re-programming my modulator and hiding from evil people. I don't actually have a plan for the trap just yet. As a woman, I know you won't understand, but I am only really capable of doing one thing at a time.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Ah, so much for your new career as a super spy. James Bond can multitask.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Yes he can,&#8221; replied Hector, &#8220;but James Bond always has a sexy babe to help him out through the tricky bits of the mission. I am still looking for one of those. Then everything will be - ouch.&#8221; Sylvia's elbow dug into Hectors ribs just a little bit harder than normal. They laughed.</p>
            <p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Sylvia, &#8220;What is Lothsen's key weakness? What does he want so badly that we can use it to lure him in?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Lothsen craves power and money. That's his motivation.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Could you maybe only pretend to help him but actually be working on something else? What are the chances of it even being possible to move stuff between universes? If it is not possible, you could work on it as long as he wants without fear of giving him such a tool.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;As far as I know it is not possible for anything but humans to achieve the DNA modulation possible to move between universes. Our DNA frequency is what makes us unique. A bar of gold, for example, just won't be able to make the switch.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;But Lothsen doesn't know that, does he?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;No, but I can't be certain of that hypothesis. There have been too many surprises already for me to be sure of much in the multiverse. For example, how did I end up here at all? There is no way the modulator back in the lab was ready to work, but suddenly in the midst of a standard check of the equipment I found myself in a Cambridge containing a giant Mayan temple. And then&#8230;"</p>
            <p>&#8220;Wait a minute, a Mayan Cambridge is where Rob and the kids first visited. If there are zillions of universes the chance of you both going to the same one on a random choice is nil, and yet you did.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Well spotted, when I programmed the DNA modulators I had to put in a sequence of universes as defaults. I was about to use a random number generator so that the universes visited would be truly random. I am really, really glad I changed my mind and instead used a very simple formula to create an apparently random, but repeatable series of universes. I used the same formula in both devices, so yes, Rob and the twins have been following through the same universes as I have, and in the same order.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Did I pick a smart man for a husband or what? So if we wait here in this universe the kids will eventually arrive?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Yes, but eventually might be a very long time, I had to skip forward quite a few universes to evade Lothsen and find this one which has attributes that might be of use to us. The clues I left will, I hope, speed up the otherwise very long process of reuniting the family.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;What do you mean about attributes of this universe that might help us? Help us to trap Lothsen?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;Possibly. We need to do more exploring, but I have seen the people here do things that I can only describe as magical. This seems to be a supercharged, mystical universe. A group of people I watched stood in a circle holding hands and chanted around a marble statue. I didn't give it a second glance until the eight-foot-tall statue in the middle of the circle which must have weighed several tons, levitated twenty feet above the ground. I can only guess that the group was able to set up some sort of harmonic frequency modulations with the marble itself. If it is somehow possible to transfer goods from one universe to another, understanding how the people in this universe are able to levitate marble would be a good place to start. There must be some way we can use that to get Kane's attention at least.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;I would love exploring and documenting this universe. I could finish my anthropology doctorate degree in no time at all here. If only the twins and Rob were safe and with us.&#8221; said Sylvia.</p>
            <p>As she spoke, they rounded a corner and came face to face with a marble statue. &#8220;In fact, that's the statue there.&#8221; said Hector. The statue depicted a humble looking man in flowing robes, with a long wispy beard and big round eyes. Its plaque read: &#8220;Jochi Khan – Father of the World.&#8221;</p>
