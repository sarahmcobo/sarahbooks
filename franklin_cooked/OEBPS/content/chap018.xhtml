<p class="chapterIntro">Max Perutz of Cavendish Laboratories shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1962 with Sir John Kendrew after determining that attaching a single large atom (e.g. Mercury) to a molecule would change the X-ray diffraction pattern obtained from the crystal, making it possible to completely solve the structure of that molecule.</p>

            <p>Dear Diary,</p>
            <p>I hate it here, hate it, hate it, and hate it!!!!</p>
            <p>Being a 15 year old girl, I find constant communication as essential to life as breathing. I can't text, can't Facebook, twitter, email, or even make a phone call. The only person here capable of stringing together more than a few grunts let alone words is that nasty piece of work Lothsen.</p>
            <p>I miss my mum.</p>
            <p>After only two hours alone in this communication desert I have taken to using a pencil and paper to write a diary. Robinson Crusoe wrote a diary. It was painfully boring to read (English Lit. at school), but now I know why he wrote it; He couldn’t text. So, here it comes, my diary. Should these words ever become forced reading to school kids in the future I am very, very sorry.</p>
            <p>Name: Marnie Moncrieff</p>
            <p>Current Date: not sure.</p>
            <p>Location: St. Mary's church in the Cambridge of the horrid, bombed universe which is used as the headquarters of the &#8216;New East India Company.&#8217; Note to readers: If anybody finds this diary and is reading it, I will assume the whole multi-universe and DNA modulation thing is now common knowledge, so I won't bother trying to explain it all.</p>
            <p>I am imprisoned in a tiny room. This was probably a closet or broom cupboard in better days. Earlier today a monster of a man by the name of Kane Lothsen and three of his bodyguards took me from my brother and uncle in our home universe to this one. I was escorted to this church. Lothsen has turned out to be a total lowlife stink bag. Today he promised to release me back to my family then didn't. I now see him for what he is. Completely self-centred and ruthless.</p>
            <p>It seems that I am now the latest recruit to Lothsen’s New East India Company. From what I have seen I doubt that I am the only one in this so called company being held against their will. Lothsen took me to a fabulous universe with amazing shopping, hoping I could make myself visible to the people there - which I couldn't. He then brought me back here to the universe of his company H.Q. Outside the crack in the wall of my cell I see mostly dust. No people, no plants, no stalls in the market square, only rubble and dust. Even the sun seems bored with this universe. It is up there in the sky, but it can hardly be bothered to shine down on this dump.</p>
            <p>My captor Lothsen started being all charming, but that didn't last and only showed him to be a pathological liar later when he confined me here. One minute he harps on about organising trade between the universes so that millions of people will have better lives and he sounds almost, kind of, good. Then he ruins it by trapping me here. Will I ever see my family again? I told him that Dad would come and rescue me. He just laughed an evil laugh and said that was the whole point. I am the bait for capturing my Dad. Dad is a really intelligent scientist and Lothsen thinks dad will help him with the technology needed for his evil plan. That just makes me feel worse about my predicament. I miss Dad too.</p>
            <p>I am being forced into labour here for the New East India Company. How ironic is that? Back home I couldn’t even get a job pushing tourists along the river in a punt and now I am the new staff training officer for a firm which someday may literally own not just the world, but zillions of universes. I guess it is better than a salt mine, child factory labour, or diamond mining. Lothsen said I was a natural trainer after watching me telling all his goons how to dress more appropriately. Really, anybody with even the least bit of fashion sense could have done that, but they were lapping it up and Lothsen liked that they listened to me. A few hours later they had all traded their stupid looking business suits for black turtleneck jumpers and khaki cargo trousers. They look pretty smart now if I do say so myself. My squad of goons consists of about 30 men I think. I have never seen them all at once so I am not sure how many of them there really are.</p>
            <p>I am even missing my snotty brother Matt. I have never been this alone and cut off from everybody in my life. I take back all the bad things I said about you and your dull diary Mr. Robinson Crusoe. You lived alone for years and years. I have now managed 3 hours and am going mad. I can't believe I just wrote that I miss Matt. Surely that is a sign of impending insanity.</p>
            <p>I could distract myself with my work. Lothsen gave me 3 big books he stole from the remains of the Cambridge city library in this universe. Two are history books, with a few pictures! The third is a dissertation by some local academic entitled &#8216;Empire building: A guide: How the East India Company altered Britain, the global economy and devoured emerging countries.&#8217; I am looking forward to spending many happy hours with that book to keep me occupied - NOT. I think I'll try to sleep.</p>
    <p class="centered">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
            <p>Marnie's Diary, Day 2 in captivity:</p>
            <p>I am really tired. This morning I started the New East India Company boot camp. They only made me do the morning session. I think they actually felt sorry for me. I wasn't the only girl, but must have been the only person who had not been doing 50 push-ups and running 5 miles every day back in normal life. I so am unfit. The universes that the other enlisted people came from must be very physical.</p>
            <p>We have Evans, a sergeant major type who yelled at us a lot. I think he yells so much at people because he is so short. He's like one of those little yappy dogs that bark all the time because of a dog inferiority complex. Evans is short, has black hair and is very muscular. There are 8 recruits including me in this group or &#8216;cell&#8217; as Evans calls us. I didn't get much time to talk with the others mainly because I couldn't spare the oxygen to make conversation. I did gather that the other 7 came from at least two different universes. I would guess those universes were in the middle of long wars or something because my fellow trainees were very adept at the Kung Foo stuff we were learning. While they were doing Kung Foo or something, I was flinging my arms and legs around but would not have made much of an impression on a feather pillow had I managed to make contact with one. I had the impression some of my cell members were actually here by choice, unlike me.</p>
            <p>Where is my family now? I hope they come for me soon. Will Lothsen trap them if they do come for me? Maybe I can escape somehow?</p>
            <p>By lunch, Evans must have decided I was always going to be a terrible soldier for the company. I was taken away from the others to continue my education about the old East India Trading Company. I am to prepare a 3 hour induction lesson for new recruits. I didn't see Lothsen today. In fact, I haven't seen anybody since noon. I really need to talk to someone, anyone. This solitary confinement is torture. We do seem to be allowed to wander around a little and I am not locked in my cell, but there is nowhere to go and nobody around this afternoon anyway. I don't know where the other new recruits have gone, probably off to some Kung Foo universe for more practice I guess.</p>
            <p>Lothsen left a note. It said I will teach my first class tomorrow at 14:00 hours and he would be attending to &#8216;ensure quality standards were met.&#8217; What a load of cobblers! He also left a course outline and lots of items I was to be sure to include. Honestly, he should just do this himself.</p>
            <p>I read as much of the textbooks and that stupid dissertation about Empire Building as I could stomach. That original East India Company sounds pretty ruthless. I thought the big nasty corporations of my time and universe were bad, but this British East India Company managed to obtain monopoly status from the British government which they used to deal in Indian textiles (fine), opium (not so good), and slaves (v. bad). The sections of the book highlighted by Lothsen were mostly about how they pretty much took control of any small country which had something of value they could sell. If and when I get home I'll read our history books and see if our East India Company was so bad. I can't believe I just wrote that, actually wanting to read a history book! That will be the second indicator of my looming insanity.</p>
            <p>The East India Company managed to tax people in other countries and if they were the only ones buying something like cloth, they would drive the buying price so low that local producers could barely survive. They would burn factories that provided goods to other traders and cut off the fingers of weavers that sold cloth to anyone else!</p>
            <p>Lothsen must not attain anything like the kind of power and control his namesake company had. And yet, I am meant to be training the soldiers in the &#8216;grand history&#8217; - as Lothsen writes, of the East India Company. What am I going to do?</p>
            <p>I am lonely. Surely dad will come rescue me tomorrow. Good night diary.</p>
