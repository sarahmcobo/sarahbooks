            <p class="texttop"><span class="dropcap">C</span>ambridge, England - In Maitland and Jessica Smythe's home universe, some months before Hector's first inter-universe travel.</p>
            <p>Horse's hooves clip clopped on the asphalt and the smell of horse filled the air. Maitland knew this place by its sound and smell alone. If blindfolded for days, driven around the country, then dropped here with a bag over his head and he would instantly know he was in the horse stalls built by Jessica Smythe's father. He hated it here.</p>
            <p>Everything was wrong for Maitland. The Smythes took what should be a wild animal, the horse, and used it as a plaything and status symbol. At any one time, ten to fifteen horses lived here in pampered luxury. When a horse had a dump on the floor, a man came along to clean it up in minutes. The horse food bills alone were far in excess of Maitland's income and the stalls were of better quality than Maitland's flat.</p>
            <p>These animal condominiums were a sharp reminder to Maitland of his inadequacy. He had spent much of his childhood until the age of about 12 living on the Smythe estate. His mother worked here as a live-in housekeeper. She and Maitland were given a nice little flat in one of the many outbuildings on the estate. Jessica was an only child and only a few months older than Maitland so as the only two children on the estate it was inevitable they would play together. The relationship between the children was always troublesome though. It was not Jessica's fault, but Maitland always felt like the hired help rather than a friend. Had the Smythe family only purchased a playmate for their lonely daughter?</p>
            <p>Now that Maitland was older, and his mother had died, Jessica let him use a few of the empty sheds near the stables for his business endeavours. Maitland appreciated and needed the free storage space, but it hurt his pride to still be dependent on Jessica and her family even as an adult.</p>
            <p>Today Maitland was going through a shipment of goods he had purchased very cheaply and quickly from one of his regular suppliers. To describe Maitland as a fence for stolen goods would be a little harsh. Some of the items he bought and sold were not stolen. However, the urgency of this latest deal suggested that these goods were hot. Jessica did not ask or think to ask what Maitland was storing in their sheds. She did not think Maitland would get involved in something overly dishonest here and took the view that it was best not to know what he was up to.</p>
            <p>The boxes spread around the dirty floor of the makeshift mini-warehouse appeared to Maitland to have come from a laboratory, perhaps one of the universities or private labs that littered Cambridge. Among the booties were computing devices of all sorts, glass tubes and beakers, and large boxes of electronics. One box in particular caught Maitland's eye because of three distinctive items. He took from it an object which could only be described as an electronic Frisbee, a stick similar to a ski pole and a tablet computer. The items were all of a polished metal like aluminium and were obviously meant to work together, but to what purpose? Curious and wondering how much he might be able to sell them for Maitland turned on the tablet and began to experiment.</p>
            <p>That was how it had started for Maitland. Kane Lothsen and his men had seen the new inter-universe traveler with their monitors. They pounced on a dumbfounded Maitland who had found himself in an uninhabited Cambridge populated only by wild animals. Lothsen soon realised that Maitland could be an asset, and he hired him as a scout, someone to find universes to exploit.</p>
    <p class="centered">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
            <p>Jessica never went into the shed space she had given over to Maitland to use. Why would she? She did, however, occasionally notice when Maitland was there. She had never been very close to him as when they were children, but now she cared deeply for her slightly wayward childhood friend. Now and then when she knew he was in she would take out one of her horses just to make the opportunity for a chance encounter. She only wanted to catch up with Maitland and perhaps to lend a hand if she could. Jessica was acutely aware that hers was a privileged life with wealthy parents providing all the comforts and security she would ever need. She also knew that Maitland resented her for that. This all led to a strange guilt, and she wanted to do something to help Maitland without making the situation even worse.</p>
            <p>Jessica was walking her horse past Maitland's shed when she thought she heard a thump inside. Was something the matter? Should she disturb Maitland's privacy by checking on him? She waited, listening carefully. Maybe she had only heard things that were not there? No, now she distinctly heard Maitland coughing and moaning. He was hurt. Jessica would have to check on him. She left her horse and peered inside the dark shed. Maitland was flat out face down on the floor.</p>
            <p>Groggy from his first inter-universe return trip Maitland was just coming around from passing out when he felt Jessica lifting his head off the floor and pulling him gently to a sitting position. She sat with him as he regained consciousness. It was the first time they had been this close in years.</p>
            <p>Maitland opened his eyes, shocked at the sight of Jessica. Ten minutes later he had told her about the box of equipment, his trip to another universe and of Kane Lothsen and his New East India Company that had found him there.</p>
            <p>Jessica of course did not believe him, but couldn't guess why Maitland would or even could invent such a tale, especially in the instant of recovering consciousness. For the next night and day Jessica could think of nothing but the possibility of other universes, places where anything was possible. If this Kane Lothsen was real, his firm stood against everything Jessica knew was right. Was she just a spoiled rich kid with lofty ideals about solving world poverty, hunger and global warming? Was she a woman of action? Jessica was determined to make the most of her good fortune and be the latter.</p>
            <p>Having made her decision, Jessica was ruthless in using all her contacts to find the original owner of the Frisbee, tablet and ski pole apparatus which had taken Maitland to the other universe. Before long Jessica had made her first inter-universe jump and kicked off her plans to make the worlds, all of them, a better place without Lothsen in control.</p>
    <p class="centered">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
            <p>The next evening - Maitland's home universe.</p>
            <p>Holding on to his empty glass Maitland was conscious of the overhead spotlight reflecting off his polyester silk-like suit. That lustre where there should have been the non-reflective, sophisticated tight wool blend was a beacon to all that was wrong in his life. He was wearing someone else's skin.</p>
            <p>Maitland ordered another Bacardi and Coke. It was the easy thing to do as he sat at his usual stool at the end of the bar. The other regular drinkers of the White Swan were only just starting to take their places on this Friday evening. Some of the other regulars would acknowledge Maitland with a slight nod of the head, but as often as not mere eye contact was the accepted greeting here. It was not that the clients of this establishment were ill mannered or pompous, quite the opposite. As a very local, local pub they all had known each other for so long there was no need or desire for effervescent greetings. As a demonstration of this familiarity, the clientele cheekily referred to it as the Dirty Duck rather than The White Swan. Over the years all traces of formality here had been replaced with an easy, reserved, uniquely English demeanour.</p>
            <p>Another argument with his girlfriend Mel had brought Maitland to his bar stool earlier than usual today. Tonight there would be a session. He could feel it. He rarely came out with the intention of getting drunk, but sometimes an elongated drinking session would announce itself almost as soon as Maitland perched atop this stool. It was almost as if the four legged seat was in control of Maitland's evening. His drinking buddies had not arrived yet but would be trickling in and out over the next few hours.</p>
            <p>His drink arrived; he swirled it idly as his eyes wandered with equal idleness about the familiar surroundings. He wondered where pubs like this one buy their carpets. The Duck had a floor covering of brown and orange in a pattern that must have been specially created to look exactly the same whether freshly cleaned or covered in a month's spilled beer and crisps. Then there were the light fittings, they were plastic made to look like brass. They looked to come from a period that would embarrass even your grandmother. Did even their designer like them? Perhaps they were an accident? Someone in China misread the blueprints and manufactured ten million cheap looking light fittings. Realizing his mistake Mr. China-man intended to dump them into the Yangtze River but at the last moment they were saved by a shrewd businessman who sold them to pubs all over the United Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But light fittings were not his problem. It was always the same argument with Mel. She expected the lifestyle her parents had provided for her, a big house and garden, several exotic holidays a year and certainly never having to worry about being able to afford the best cuts of meat or dinner in a restaurant whenever she felt like it. Maitland could not provide that lifestyle. Mel was right; this was no way to exist, always hand to mouth, never quite enough money and worst of all no prospect of the situation getting any better.</p>
            <p>He explained again and again to Mel that things had changed now. Even her parents, if they were young now, would not be able to buy the idyllic life of her childhood. The economies of the world had been shot down, probably never to return to the dizzy heights of half a generation ago. The brilliant scientists and medical technicians at the &#8216;Cambridge Medical Research for Life&#8217; (C.M.R.L.) had achieved their dual goals of ending both cancer and heart disease but in so doing had defecated on the economy as a pigeon would after a spaghetti banquet. Old people just didn't die anymore. That meant they had to keep working, as no pension plan would cover to an average life expectancy of 122. Because older people kept working, there were few jobs for Maitland's generation. It would all work out better eventually they said. In another 50 years or so the systems would adjust, little good that would do Maitland, his drinking buddies or his relationship with Mel. Why did those Cambridge University medical scientists have to be so damn smart? And why in his generation?</p>
            <p>Glancing around the Dirty Duck Maitland wondered&#8230; instead of curing cancer, if the academics had focused their big brains on something like the human ecosystem inside the Dirty Duck how different his life would have been. It would make a cracking Ph.D. dissertation; the unspoken social order of this place could be pontificated over ad infinitum, or as Sally behind the bar would say &#8216;till the eeeffffiiin cows come home'. Already this evening there are distinct groups of friends huddled together. Each group interacts with other groups only in relation to mutually agreed but unspoken events such as an England football match, or a spectacular gaffe from a politician. The avenues for academic study of the Dirty Duck are endless. The result would have been old people still dying on schedule and jobs for Maitland and his contemporaries.</p>
            <p>Owing to the newfound longevity of their parents&#8217; generation Maitland and many others like him in Cambridge and around the world had to develop strategies to cope with perpetual unemployment. Maitland and his friends were not lazy or stupid. There were just very few jobs. Many turned to theft or embezzlement for cash; others chose drugs to hide from their problems. Maitland and his small gang of mates stuck to predominantly fairly legal activities in an attempt to make ends meet. They were businessmen without businesses. If you wanted something, anything and could pay for it, Maitland would know somebody that could get it for you. It might be a used car at a bargain price from a less than reputable source, or a new computer that fell off the back of a lorry. If there was a quick buck or quid to be made, Maitland and his friends would make it happen.</p>
            <p>Maitland reached the bottom of another Bacardi and Coke. Wishing for more ice to slosh around in his mouth, he considered where he had been and the things he had seen over the past few days. This bar stool where he had perched as often as not of an evening for the past 10 years was opposite in every way to traversing in parallel universes. And what of Kane Lothsen and his New East India Trading Company?</p>
            <p>Had Maitland found a way out of poverty, despair and his polyester suit? Could he attain the lifestyle he and Mel deserved? Like a bloodhound after a hare, he smelled an opportunity. There was a fortune to be made in the new universes he had stumbled on. Kane Lothsen was going about it all wrong though. Lothsen's New East India Trading Company wanted to tax goods being traded across universes, but that was reliant upon a yet to be discovered technology. Hell, it might not even be possible to transfer goods from one universe to another. Maitland was smarter than that. He had learned the hard way from years of making a pound or two where none existed. His experience of shady deals with dodgy characters in back alleys had taught him the surest way to make a profit was to exploit good old fashioned human greed. Don't rely on technology when human nature is so much more reliable. Maitland and his buddies had done it so many times before. Find your mark, determine what he wants, and then figure out how to extract money from him. Actual delivery of any good or service was rarely the key if you played your cards right. Lothsen was the mark, but how to play him?</p>
            <p>In the middle of that thought, Paul and Mark strode into the pub dressed smartly in shiny, polyester, silk-effect business suits like Maitland's. The difference was that Paul and Mark were wearing their own skins, the right suits. These three had known each other as long for as they could remember. They were not the best of friends; the personalities were very different, but like a pair of shoes that just wouldn't wear out Paul, Sam and Maitland were always around each other. They lived on the same street and had grown through their teenage years together. They knew each other better than the backs of their own hands. The three made a formidable alliance when it came to wheeling and dealing. They could sell snake oil to a cobra or slime to a politician. Together the three of them would be able to turn a profit from Kane Lothsen and his greedy inter-universe ambitions. Lothsen would be his way out, his way out of this shiny suit.</p>
            <p>&#8220;My round&#8221; Maitland barked to Sally behind the bar as Paul and Mark came towards him. It was going to be a session tonight, perhaps one that would change everything.</p>
