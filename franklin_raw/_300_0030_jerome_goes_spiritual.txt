The engineering work in the depths of the earth would continue for decades, but the planet seemed to be holding fire so far. Perhaps she was curious what the humans would do next?

The gargantuan engineering project to tame the super-volcano masterminded by Jerome gave the governments of earth had a common enemy on which to focus their efforts rather than fighting among themselves. The United Nations, finally found something to unite against giving the institution a valid reason to exist. A veil of peace spread over the domain of men. Slowly, month by month and year upon year peace became the norm, a habit.

Having guided his fellow men toward peace Jerome was now pleased to listen to the news broadcasts on the radio. When he walked the beaches of his island home, his thoughts returned to his childhood and thoughts of all those others on similar beaches around the great Atlantic ocean. He was separated from them by so far, yet also so little.

Jerome then left the fields of geology, science, and engineering. The wheels he had set in motion regarding the volcano would continue turning without him.
 
Jerome visited all the world's top religious leaders. Jerome was gathering data, collecting ideas for his next challenge.

Then he then vanished.
