# Travelling

Following his talks with leaders of many religions, he took the life of a hermit monk. He lived on a sparsely inhabited island in Pugeot Sound near Seattle. Here, the whales and eagles taught him humility and respect for nature. As the months wore on he discovered a new layer to the rich fabric of the universe. His channelled his genius into the spiritual realm where he developed methods that put him in touch with people, not of his home planet. These were not aliens from outer space, but people like him with names like Hector, Marnie, Matt and many others. Jerome learned to travel among the many universes which surround us all. More than that, he found that without trying he often materialise, to those with minds open to see him, when they needed him the most.

Jerome had created peace in his universe and staved off a cataclysmic global event. He had found a way to "make a difference in the world and to change something." Now, he was learning the art of communicating with people across endless oceans and universes, he could now help others, like Marnie, to do the same.
