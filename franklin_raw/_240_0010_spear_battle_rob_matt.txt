"Uncle Rob, Uncle Rob, get up quick! We need to get out of here fast." Matt and Rob had just transported into the next universe in the pi sequence and into the middle of a battle. Spears and arrows flew past in all directions. Matt had just come to his senses. They had taken to sitting cross-legged on the ground before clicking the button on the tablet computer which controlled the Frisbee device which in turn took huge amounts of power from the thing that looked like a ski pole and cast them into somewhere new and different. They still ended up on the ground every time. This time Rob and Matt were in deep mud.
 
Rob was just regaining consciousness as a spear passed right through him and into the arm of a teenage boy standing just behind them. Matt saw the whole horrible scene as if in slow motion. The spear went through Rob without slowing down or causing any damage to him, but when it hit the boy, a thin, blond lad about Matt's own age, it was as if his left arm exploded with red as the spear pierced an artery. In a flash, an older woman rushed to him from out of the pack of people further behind them. Matt now realised she must be the boy's mother. She applied pressure to the wound stemming the flow of blood. Six inches to one side and the spear would have pierced her son's heart. As it was, he was lucky, and well looked after. The mother was furious and scared.
 
Rob finally recovered his senses and shouted "What was that, did you see it? Something went right through me, what was it?" He had one hand on his chest and the other on his back roughly where the spear had gone through him."
 
"It must be like when we walked through people in other universes," Matt said. "Matter can go through us, but as the molecules are different, or we are different here it does not really touch us. Uncle Rob... look behind you."
 
Rob saw the pale colour of Matt's face and turned slowly to face the bloodshed behind them. He watched the mother and son hobble together to the relative safety of a makeshift fort further behind the front line. Not knowing what else to do, Rob and Matt followed them, away from the lamp post on Parker's Piece.

The mother of the spear victim sat holding her boy, both were covered in his blood. He was pale and barely conscious, but a makeshift tourniquet had been applied. He would live. Their friends gathered around in silence. The small group was all silently imagining themselves seriously wounded. Seconds passed slowly as they stood like statues. Finally, the mother slowly passed her son to a friend gently for further care and with sudden confidence and steely resolve stood to face the crowd surrounding her. "Enough is enough." she said in a strong, commanding voice. "I am putting an end to this petty war here and now, get me paper and a pen someone."
 
Parker's Piece on this day, in this universe, was muddy and strewn with used weapons and trash. Three small shanty towns sat in three corners of the field. Nearer the middle of the field stood three basic fortresses. At the very middle was the lamp post. These forts were only very slightly sturdier than ramshackle shanty towns cobbled together from bits of scavenged materials. This war was an immature operation, but a spear cut by hand from a nearby tree can still cause devastating damage.
 
In a few minutes the mother had completed her writing, white flags had been raised and the leaders of the three opposing tribes and their councils stood angrily facing each other in the middle of Parker's Piece. The mother stood in the centre of them all, scribbled notes in her hand with the lamp post at her back. The tribe leaders carried weapons, spears, arrows, and stones to throw. They glared at each other. The momentary truce was fragile. Sensing that her allotted time was short the mother read quickly from her notes:
<p><br/></p> 
<p class="simulate_blockquote">Boys need not kill other boys because of mistakes their fathers made. You are not troops, you are your mother's sons and daughters. You are people with your own lives to live, not to die for people you have never met. Your future is more important than anyone's past.</p>
<p><br/></p> 
<p class="simulate_blockquote">Stand on your own two feet, listen to your own mind. Ask your heart if you truly understand the cause for which you are being asked to murder a fellow human being.</p>
<p><br/></p> 
<p class="simulate_blockquote">I am older than most of you. When I was a child here in Cambridge, there were no gangs at war. This was not a tribal city. Who here even remembers why you are are fighting each other? I'll tell you why. Our troubles were started by a scientist, Max Longhurst, who worked in a chemistry lab only a few miles from where we stand. Professor Longhurst developed a miracle chemical to improve agricultural yields. It promised to end global starvation and malnutrition forever. The Matrix Foods and Chemical giant bought the patent for this DDT based chemical which combined insecticides and fertilizers. Matrix pushed governments hard for licenses to sell the chemical. Trials were held for only two summers in fields south of here, bribes were paid and the chemical was licensed. For a few years crop yields grew exponentially, as did the profits of the Matrix Company.</p>
<p><br/></p> 
<p class="simulate_blockquote">However it was soon discovered that, like DDT, this new compound was not very well understood. Soon the farm lands it had been used on became barren and exhausted, poisoned by those chemicals. That is when people like you and I banded into tribes thinking these groups would protect us. As you can now see by looking around you, these gangs or tribes do nothing but fight other tribes. Rather than protecting us or helping us to produce food and other necessities of life you throw our sons and daughters into battle, achieving nothing.</p>
<p><br/></p>
The mother was now glaring at the leaders of the three tribes before her. They were strong, young, armed, and dressed in war paints and full of anger. But they knew the defenceless woman was right. You could see it in their eyes.
 
Rob nudged Matt, "Letâ€™s get up to that lamp post and see if there is a message from Hector. I know they can't see us, but if this turns nasty I'd rather not have any more spears going through me." They sneaked up behind the mother. Even if you know you are invisible it is simply not possible not to appear sneaky when you don't want to be seen.
 
Matt reached the lamp post first, crouched down to its base and read, "95673 Where is Reality?"
