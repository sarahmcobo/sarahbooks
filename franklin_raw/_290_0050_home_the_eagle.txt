The spring sunshine of the family's home universe felt unusually warm and bright as Hector carried a tray of drinks to an outside table at the Eagle Pub. Sylvia had one arm around Matt and was holding Marnie securely with the other. Rob sat across the table, excitedly retelling one story after another from their inter-universe adventures. Hector smiled at them as he distributed soft drinks to the kids, white wine to Sylvia and a pint of cider to Rob. The family had just been reunited and Hector decided the Eagle was the perfect place to catch up and try to figure out what had happened to them all. The excitement and emotion around their table was electric with everyone clamouring to get a word in edgewise. Slowly the pieces started to fall into place.
 
Only Marnie seemed quiet and a little reserved. Finally Hector asked her. "What did you hear Maitland saying just before we returned?"
 
"I couldn't see them, but I heard three men talking, one was Maitland. I didn't recognize the voices of the other two, but they had Maitland's accent, they probably all came from the same place. They called each other Paul and Mark. Maitland was obviously in charge, telling the others that he saw Jerome giving me the necklace in the universe of gold. He is convinced that the man with the big hat is the key. They are going to go after him now. They think I am the key to getting him for some reason."
 
"We shouldn't have ignored the enigmatic Jerome." said Sylvia. "I wish we understood him. Maitland might be right that Jerome is the key to something about those universes."
Hector put down his glass and chipped in, "Jerome must have some way of modulating his own DNA. Some mystic, yogi people in our universe claim to be able to control their own heartbeat, perhaps Jerome does something like that but on a different scale?"

Matt leaned forward and said to Marnie, "You said you wanted to make a difference in the world and to change something. You certainly have."
