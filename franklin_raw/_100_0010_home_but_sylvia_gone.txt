"Uncle Rob, get out the modulator and take us back home to Mum. She will be able to make some sense of this. We just need to find Dad."
 
Rob proceeded to set up the Frisbee and stick DNA modulator combination. After the usual nausea and waking up on the ground, Matt and Rob looked around and found themselves in the familiar Cambridge of their home world. It was still a warm, sunny spring day, although dusk and a nice sunset would be upon the city soon. They ran back to the Old Cavendish labs. They had only been away a few hours, but had travelled through three universes and discovered so much. To them it seemed that they had been gone for ages.
 
They dashed through the gates of the lab buildings, up the stairs, and burst into the lab.
 
"Mum, we're back!" shouted Matt. His words bounced off the walls of the tiny room. There was no reply.
 
"Mum...., where are you?"
