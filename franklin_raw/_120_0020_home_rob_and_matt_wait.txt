An hour had elapsed uneventfully in the lab for Rob and Matt. They had arrived back home desperate to see Sylvia and make a plan for getting Marnie back. They wanted to tell Sylvia about their journeys to the Tesla energy universe of the Trade Free people and the New East India Company. It seemed like a long time to them since eating ice cream in the universe without money where they learned they could speak with people in other universes. They were exhausted, sitting and waiting, hoping Sylvia would at any moment walk through the door with a bag of groceries; anything normal would be great.
 
"What are we going to do?" Matt asked, staring at the walls of the lab. "If Mum had just popped out for lunch or something she would be back by now and surely would have left a note. Something is wrong."
 
"I know these walls have witnessed brilliant science over the years," said Rob. "Are you asking the walls of Old Cavendish or me?"
 
Matt turned to his uncle, "I just want to find mum and dad. How do we even begin?"
 
"Well," said Rob "if we were the New East India Trading Company we would have a big whiteboard, draw up everything we know, make connections between facts, and hope for a solution to come to light."
 
"Good idea," said Matt. "We don't have a whiteboard, but here are some big sheets of oversize paper. I'll clear the table and spread them out."
 
"What's that on the envelope?" Rob asked as Matt was about to pile it onto a chair with other bits of paper and lab gadgets. "It says, 'Round Pies 20p each.' How odd, do you remember that being here before?"
 
Matt replied, "No, but never mind. Let's start writing what we know on these big sheets of paper."
