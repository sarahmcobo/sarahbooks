Hector and Marnie watched as Jessica and a friend of Maitland's materialised on the ground not far from where Jessica had disappeared from a few minutes earlier. Jessica came towards Hector and Marnie, "I am so, so sorry for dragging you and your family into this mess. We'll return to the New East India Company universe, get your DNA modulator, and then you both can go home and join the rest of your family."
 
"Where is Lothsen?" asked Hector, "Will he still be chasing me?"
 
"Don't worry about him. He won't be disturbing anyone for the foreseeable future." replied Jessica. "Let's get you two home."
 
Jessica, Maitland, Marnie, Hector and the others left the dazzling gold universe behind. Maitland found it particularly difficult to leave. Once in the dank universe of the New East India Company headquarters they searched Lothsen's office for Hector's DNA modulator. While Hector and Marnie were thanking Jessica, Maitland sloped off into the next room.
 
Having found the modulator, Hector started setting it up. Marnie decided to find Maitland to say goodbye, it seemed odd to just leave without saying anything. Stepping out of Lothsen's office, she heard Maitland's voice in a loud whisper somewhere close. Looking around, she guessed it was coming from down the gallery and around the corner. As she approached, his words became distinguishable. What she heard made her turn immediately.
 
"Marnie, let's go." called Hector. She ran back to stand by her father as he prepared to flip the switch and take them home.
 
"Yes, quickly, and dad, I need to tell you what I just heard Maitland saying." Marnie whispered to her dad so Jessica couldn't hear.
 
Hector looked at Marnie and frowned, whispering back, "This isn't over is it?"
 
Marnie nodded negatively, "Maybe not but at least we'll all be together. Let's go."
 
Hector pressed the button on his modulator and took them home.
