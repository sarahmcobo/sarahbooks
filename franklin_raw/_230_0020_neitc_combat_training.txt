In the universe of the New East India Trading Company headquarters, Lothsen shouted at his thug recruits. The same 6 of them that were in the classroom were now training in hand to hand combat in the graveyard outside the church. The smell of dust and blood filled the air. Two of the recruits had been given red jerseys to wear. The other four had been given the job of chasing them down and 'killing' them which involved the two recruits being beaten senseless. Lothsen watched the battle with glee. This task had been described to the men by Lothsen as a training exercise, to learn and use skills they would need in defending the Company against future aggressors and firms jealous of their soon to be found power and riches. In fact, it was primarily entertainment. Lothsen sat in a huge chair overlooking the spectacle like an ancient king would watch their knights battle to the death in tournaments.
 
At that moment, four of the thugs had one of the red shirted ones cornered and they were approaching him with threats and jeers. Lothsen watched with anticipation, knowing the other red shirted man was hidden in the tree above them. This could get very interesting thought Lothsen leaning forward on his makeshift throne.
