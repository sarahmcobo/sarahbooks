The next day Hector went to work as usual in his curious old lab. Since 1874 when the Cavendish labs were established no less than twenty-nine Nobel Prizes had been awarded to scientists working in this and the surrounding buildings. Hector kept a picture of James Maxwell the mathematician and physicist on his messy desk. He told his children to always say "hello" to James when they entered the lab and to say "goodbye" to him when they left. Maxwell was the first to demonstrate that electricity, magnetism, and light are all different manifestations of the same thing and he had opened this very lab. Maxwell was Scottish like Hector. It is said that Albert Einstein kept a photo of Maxwell on his desk, too. Hector liked it that Marnie and Matt were always polite to the old guy.
 
The success of the Cavendish labs had inevitably led to much growth. Researchers and scientists from all over the world clamoured to work in the quaint and esoteric hodgepodge of rooms crammed into the centre of Cambridge. Sadly there was simply not enough floor space and the university made the difficult decision to move to new and larger premises to the west of the city. Hector refused to move to the new site. In the old labs, he said he could feel the presence of the masters who had done great work there. A compromise had been reached with the university. He could keep the attic room while the rest of the buildings were put to other uses. Hector came to love the arrangement. It gave him a calm environment away from the sometimes mad circus of research establishments.
 
The day after Marnie decided to make her mark on the world, Hector entered his lab through the normal door and left it by oscillating sideways into another universe.

And when it was over, it was over.
