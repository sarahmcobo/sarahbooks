Every so often a soul is born that is destined to stand head and shoulders above the others of his or her time. Such a life is so exceedingly rare that if one were able to look across 10,000 universes each nurturing billions of people there might be one or two such people. Leonardo da Vinci was the nearest Hector's universe had come to such a polymath. Da Vinci mastered art, science, mechanics among a long list of challenging disciplines. He was not only a genius in one field like Albert Einstein, nor was Da Vinci just "fairly good" at a lot of things, he was a genius in multiple, diverse fields. His mind was simply not constrained like that of everyone else.
