Neither the falcons watching the battle that evening, nor Genghis, nor Jochi nor Ogedei understood the significance of Jochi's moment of revelation. At that point in time, a major branch was made in the multiverse. In one branch, Jochi had his spiritual awakening, in another branch that moment did not come. In the worlds where Jochi won the wrestling match that day the brothers continued to argue throughout their lives. The Khan dynasty continued to extend beyond the Black Sea into Eastern Europe, but with the eventual death of Genghis the empire was split between Jochi, Ogedei and the two other sons of Genghis Khan. Within a few short generations the empire receded, becoming largely irrelevant to future generations.
 
The universe which grew out of Jochi's epiphany and loss of the fight against his brother saw the Mongol empire expand throughout the Asia and Europe all the way from the South China Sea to the Scottish Isles of Great Britain. In this universe, Jochi and Ogedei became a team the likes of which the world had not seen before or since. Ogedei grew into a mature and most formidable warrior, taking over countries by force of will as much as by military strength. For his part, Jochi went on to master many religions and philosophies, blending them into his own beliefs. While Ogedei was merging countries into one empire, Ogedei did the same with religions. The people taken over by the military might of Ogedei were peacefully encouraged to unite behind the all-encompassing religions of Jochi. Tolerance was the watchword. There was no term for "religious war." Europe and Asia, East and West were united as one by the Mongols. The unification was long lasting tooâ€”in those universes.
